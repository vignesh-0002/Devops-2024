# Upwork Project: EC2 Setup with GUI and NICE DCV (Graviton ARM)

To successfully deliver on this Upwork project, follow these key steps and be comfortable with the associated tools and concepts.

---

## ‚úÖ 1. Launch EC2 Instance (`c7g.8xlarge` with AWS Linux)

### What You Need to Know:
- EC2 instance types, especially **Graviton-based ARM architecture** (c7g.8xlarge)
- **Amazon Linux 2023** or **Amazon Linux 2** (verify compatibility with c7g)
- Setting up **security groups** (allowing NICE DCV ports, SSH, etc.)
- Choosing the correct **AMI** that supports GUI + NICE DCV (Amazon Linux ARM64 might have limitations)

### Steps:
1. Log in to AWS Console
2. Launch EC2 using:
   - Instance Type: `c7g.8xlarge`
   - AMI: Amazon Linux (ARM64)
3. Configure:
   - Networking
   - Storage
   - Key Pair
4. Open required ports:
   - Default NICE DCV port: `8443`

## ‚úÖ 2. Set Up GUI on Linux Instance

### What You Need to Know:
- Amazon Linux doesn't come with GUI by default
- Install lightweight GUI: **XFCE**, **MATE**, or **GNOME** (if supported)
- Ensure **desktop environment supports ARM64**

### Steps:
1. SSH into EC2
2. Use `dnf` or `yum` to install desktop environment
3. Configure GUI to start properly
4. Install required packages:
   - `xorg`, `xfce`, etc.

---

## ‚úÖ 3. Install the Application

### What You Need to Know:
- Comfortable with:
  - Linux installation instructions (manual, scripts, Makefiles)
  - Troubleshooting install errors
- Optionally use **Docker** if installation is complex

### Steps:
1. Follow application publisher's instructions
2. Resolve dependencies
3. Apply permissions
4. Verify application runs in the GUI

---

## ‚úÖ 4. Configure AWS NICE DCV

### What You Need to Know:
- NICE DCV enables **remote GUI access**
- Requires:
  - DCV server (Linux)
  - DCV client (Windows)
- Licensing and port configuration
- Compatible AMI or manual install

### Steps:
1. Install NICE DCV server on EC2 (ensure ARM compatibility)
2. Open port `8443` in Security Group
3. Create DCV user session
4. Connect from Windows client using **DCV Viewer**

---

## ‚úÖ 5. Create and Manage AMI

### What You Need to Know:
- How to create an **AMI** from a running instance
- Understand:
  - AMI limitations (region, sharing, permissions)
  - Launching new EC2 instances from AMI

### Steps:
1. In EC2 Console:
   - Select instance ‚Üí **"Create Image"**
2. Name it properly and document details
3. Show client how to use AMI via AWS Console or CLI

---

## ‚úÖ Other Key Points to Consider
- Ensure **all packages support ARM architecture** (Graviton-based)
- Set up a **swap file** or additional storage as needed
- Use **cloud-init** or **user-data scripts** for automation (if required)
- Provide **clear documentation or guide** for the client
