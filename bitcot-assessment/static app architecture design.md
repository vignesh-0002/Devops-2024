# AWS Deployment Architecture for a Full-Stack GraphQL Application

## 1. Frontend Setup (React Application)

**Task:** Deploy the React app on AWS (cost-optimized, with caching, access control, and SSL certificates).

### Architecture Steps:
- **Hosting:** Use Amazon S3 to host the static React application. S3 is cost-effective, highly scalable, and integrates well with CloudFront.
- **Content Delivery & Caching:** Integrate Amazon CloudFront (CDN) to serve the React app globally, improving latency and caching static assets (images, CSS, JS files).
- **SSL & Access Control:**  
  - Use AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to issue an SSL certificate for your domain.  
  - Use Amazon Route 53 for domain management and create DNS records pointing to CloudFront with SSL enabled.
- **Access Control:**  
  - Implement authentication via Amazon Cognito for user management.  
  - Alternatively, integrate API Gateway with Lambda-based authorizers for API access control.

### Deliverables:
‚úÖ React app hosted on S3 with CloudFront distribution.  
‚úÖ SSL certificate from ACM for HTTPS.  
‚úÖ Route 53 for DNS management.  
‚úÖ Secure API access with either Cognito or Lambda-based authorization.

## 2. Backend Setup with AWS Lambda (GraphQL Operations)

**Task:** Implement Lambda functions to handle GraphQL operations using TypeScript/Node.js and deploy using Serverless Framework or AWS SAM.

### Architecture Steps:
- **Lambda Functions:** Create AWS Lambda functions for GraphQL queries, mutations, and subscriptions. Use AWS SAM or the Serverless Framework for deployment.
- **GraphQL Server:** Use Apollo Server or GraphQL Yoga within Lambda to process GraphQL requests, ensuring validation and error handling.
- **API Gateway:** Expose Lambda functions via Amazon API Gateway to serve as the API endpoint for the frontend.

### Deliverables:
‚úÖ AWS Lambda functions deployed using SAM or Serverless Framework.  
‚úÖ Apollo Server or GraphQL Yoga in Lambda.  
‚úÖ API Gateway with routes for GraphQL operations.

## 3. Private GraphQL Server Deployment (AWS ECS Fargate)

**Task:** Deploy a private GraphQL server on ECS Fargate, ensuring security and scalability.

### Architecture Steps:
- **ECS Fargate:** Deploy the GraphQL server (e.g., Express with Apollo Server) in Amazon ECS using Fargate (no EC2 management required).
- **Private Subnet:** Ensure ECS tasks run in a private subnet within a VPC for security.
- **IAM Roles:** Assign appropriate IAM roles for ECS tasks to securely interact with AWS services (e.g., RDS).
- **Scaling:** Enable Auto Scaling for ECS tasks to handle traffic spikes.

### Deliverables:
‚úÖ Private ECS Fargate deployment.  
‚úÖ IAM roles and policies to control ECS and Lambda permissions.  
‚úÖ Auto Scaling enabled for ECS tasks.  

---

## 4. RDS Database Setup (PostgreSQL/MySQL)

**Task:** Set up an RDS instance (PostgreSQL or MySQL) for the GraphQL backend, secured within a private subnet.

### Architecture Steps:
- **VPC Configuration:** Deploy RDS in a VPC private subnet for security.
- **Security Groups:** Restrict inbound connections to only allow ECS tasks and Lambda functions to access the database.
- **RDS Instance:** Provision an RDS instance with automated backups, monitoring, and Multi-AZ deployment for high availability.

### Deliverables:
‚úÖ RDS instance with security groups restricting access.  
‚úÖ Database credentials stored securely in AWS Secrets Manager.  
‚úÖ RDS deployed in private subnets within a VPC.  

---

## 5. Lambda Function Integration with GraphQL and RDS

**Task:** Integrate Lambda functions with the GraphQL server and RDS database.

### Architecture Steps:
- **Lambda-RDS Communication:**  
  - Use RDS Data API or a Node.js PostgreSQL/MySQL client to execute queries/mutations.
- **Lambda & GraphQL Server Integration:**  
  - Ensure Lambda functions can interact with the GraphQL server deployed on ECS.
- **IAM Permissions:** Assign IAM roles to allow Lambda functions to access RDS and interact with ECS services.

### Deliverables:
‚úÖ Lambda functions interacting with GraphQL server and RDS.  
‚úÖ Proper IAM policies for Lambda and ECS roles to interact with the database securely.
