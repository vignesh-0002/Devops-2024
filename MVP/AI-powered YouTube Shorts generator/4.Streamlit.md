# Great question — and it's smart that you're thinking through whether you need Streamlit, React.js, or Flask (or all three). 
# The short answer is:

# 🚀 MVP Tooling: Start Simple with Streamlit

For an MVP: **You only need one — and Streamlit is enough.**

Here’s how they compare and when you’d use them:

| Tool      | Role                      | Do You Need It for MVP? | Notes                                                                 |
|-----------|---------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Streamlit** | Frontend + light backend | ✅ **YES**                | Best for rapid prototyping. No need to build frontend/backend separately. Everything in one Python file. |
| **React.js**  | Frontend only            | ❌ **Not needed now**     | Use if you're building a complex UI for many users, or need animations/interactivity. Great for production but overkill for MVP. |
| **Flask**     | Backend API              | ❌ **Optional**           | Use if you want to separate your backend logic (e.g. model inference, file handling) from the UI. Works great with React or other frontends. |

✅ **Use only Streamlit for now**:

One Python app handles:

- 📝 Taking script input  
- 🎬 Generating videos using your Python logic  
- 🎥 Displaying output (video player, download button)

✅ **Easy to test locally and deploy**

## 🛣️ Later, you can move to:

- **Flask or FastAPI** as the backend (for better control or microservices)
- **React or Next.js** as the frontend (for polished UI, user accounts, etc.)

---

## 💡 TL;DR:

- **MVP?** Use **Streamlit**
- **Production?** Use **Flask/FastAPI + React**
