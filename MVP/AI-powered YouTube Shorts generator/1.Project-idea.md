# ðŸŽ¬ AI-Powered YouTube Shorts Generator â€“ MVP Guide

Absolutely â€” your idea is not only possible, it's actually super valuable in todayâ€™s content-driven world ðŸŽ¥ðŸ“². You're talking about building an **AI-powered YouTube Shorts generator** â€” and yes, we can totally create an MVP for that.

## ðŸŽ¯ Your MVP Goal

**Input:** A script (like a few sentences or a short story)  
**Output:** A complete, engaging vertical video (YouTube Shorts style) with:
- Text narration or voiceover
- Auto-matched images/videos (b-roll)
- Background music
- Branded or aesthetic design

## ðŸ”§ MVP Tech Stack

| Feature | Tool |
|--------|------|
| ðŸ§  AI for context matching | GPT-4 (text analysis, scene breakdown) |
| ðŸŽž Media selection | Pexels API, Unsplash, Pixabay, Pond5, Storyblocks |
| ðŸŽ¨ Video composition | [MoviePy](https://zulko.github.io/moviepy/) or FFmpeg |
| ðŸ—£ Voiceover | ElevenLabs, gTTS, or Amazon Polly |
| ðŸŽµ Background music | Free music APIs or curated local library |
| ðŸ–¥ UI | Streamlit for MVP or React if web-based |
| ðŸ“± Output Format | 9:16 (1080x1920) for Shorts / Reels / TikTok |

## ðŸ“¦ MVP Flow

1. User enters a script  
2. Script is broken into scenes (1 sentence = 1 scene)  
3. Each scene:
    - Finds a relevant image/video clip
    - Converts text to voiceover
    - Adds background music  
4. All scenes stitched into a final vertical video

---

## ðŸ§ª Proof of Concept Code (Python)

### Step 1: Break script

```python
script = "The sun rises over the mountains. Birds chirp as the forest awakens."
scenes = script.split(". ")
```
### Step 2: Search for related image/video (Pexels)
```python
import requests

def search_image(query):
    response = requests.get(
        "https://api.pexels.com/v1/search",
        headers={"Authorization": "PEXELS_API_KEY"},
        params={"query": query, "per_page": 1}
    )
    return response.json()["photos"][0]["src"]["original"]
```
### Step 3: Generate voiceover (gTTS)
```python
from gtts import gTTS

def create_voice(text, filename="voice.mp3"):
    tts = gTTS(text)
    tts.save(filename)
```
### Step 4: Stitch into video (MoviePy)
```python
from moviepy.editor import *

def create_video(scene_img, voice_file, music_file=None):
    clip = ImageClip(scene_img).set_duration(5)
    voice = AudioFileClip(voice_file)
    if music_file:
        music = AudioFileClip(music_file).volumex(0.2)
        final_audio = CompositeAudioClip([voice, music])
    else:
        final_audio = voice
    clip = clip.set_audio(final_audio)
    return clip.resize(height=1920).set_position("center")
```
### Step 5: Combine all scenes
```python
final_video = concatenate_videoclips([clip1, clip2, ...])
final_video.write_videofile("shorts_video.mp4", fps=24)
```
