# YouTube Shorts Generator MVP Tech Stack

For your YouTube Shorts Generator MVP, you'll be integrating multiple technologies to handle different aspects of the project like script analysis, media fetching, video creation, voiceover, and UI. Here's a breakdown of the best tech stack you can use for each part of the app:

## 1. Frontend (UI)
Since you need a simple UI to input scripts, view the generated video, and download it:

### Streamlit (best for MVP)
- Easy to build quick UIs with Python code, great for prototyping.
- Supports media (audio, video, images) rendering out of the box.
- Fast to set up and iterate.

**Example**: Input box for scripts, upload buttons for images, play video button, and download.

### React.js (for production, scalable)
- Better suited for a more polished UI.
- Flexible with interactive components.
- Ideal if you want a long-term solution that can scale.

**Example**: Form for script input, auto-refresh video preview, user account for saving content.

### Flask (if you want a backend with minimal setup)
- Simple to deploy and scale.
- Works well with Python tools, if you want more control over API calls or file handling.

## 2. Text Analysis and Scene Breakdown
Youâ€™ll need an AI to break down the script into scenes, choose keywords, and match media (images/videos/music):

### GPT-4 or GPT-3.5 (for natural language understanding)
- Use OpenAIâ€™s GPT to process the script, break it into scenes, extract key phrases, and add context to the scene.

**Example**: "Extract key moments from this script and match appropriate video clips."

### spaCy (for NLP and topic extraction, if you prefer open source)
- Extracts keywords, entities, and phrases from text, great for segmentation.
- Use it to identify actions, objects, or locations in the script.

### NLTK (another option for basic NLP tasks)
- Extracts entities or parts of speech, useful for fine-tuning the script breakdown.

## 3. Media Fetching (Images, Videos, Music)
Youâ€™ll need to find relevant images, videos, and music based on the script:

### Pexels API (free stock photos and videos)
- Easy to integrate and fetch images/videos based on search queries.

**Example**: "Find images related to 'sunrise over mountains'."

### Pixabay API (free images and videos)
- Similar to Pexels, can pull media files based on keywords.

### Unsplash API (for high-quality images)
- Great for searching for aesthetic images to match the script.

### Pond5 or Storyblocks (paid stock media for higher quality)
- If you need premium-quality footage, these platforms have massive media libraries.

### Free Music APIs (e.g., Free Music Archive, YouTube Audio Library)
- If you want free background music, these APIs will work well.

**Alternatively**, you can use a paid service if you need curated tracks.

## 4. Voiceover Generation
Youâ€™ll need text-to-speech for generating the voiceover:

### ElevenLabs API (advanced, high-quality voice cloning)
- Can create a human-like voiceover for your generated script, and even clone voices (optional).
- Provides high-quality audio with natural pauses and tones.

### gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) (basic, free option)
- Simple and easy to use for generating audio.
- Decent quality but less realistic than ElevenLabs.

### Amazon Polly (production-ready)
- AWS's TTS service with multiple voice options and languages.
- Works well with high-scale applications.

### ResponsiveVoice API (another good option for voice generation)

## 5. Video Composition and Editing
This is where the magic happens â€” youâ€™ll need a tool to stitch all the elements (images, video clips, voiceover, music) into a cohesive video:

### MoviePy (Python library)
- Python library that makes video editing easy.
- Supports merging clips, adding text, and syncing audio.
- Great for building and editing videos programmatically.

### FFmpeg (command-line tool)
- Powerful, open-source tool for video/audio processing.
- Integrates well with Python (via ffmpeg-python package).
- Ideal for more complex video processing tasks.

### OpenCV (if you want advanced video processing features)
- Works well if you need additional control over video frames or want to add animations.

## 6. Backend (Server)
Youâ€™ll need a backend to handle API calls, manage media processing, and serve the final video:

### Flask (lightweight Python web framework)
- Quick and easy for building simple backends.
- Can handle requests to external APIs (e.g., GPT, Pexels, ElevenLabs) and manage media files.

### FastAPI (fast and modern Python web framework)
- Works well for building scalable APIs if your app grows.
- Supports async operations for handling media generation efficiently.

### Node.js (Express) (alternative if you prefer JavaScript)
- Good choice if you want a more scalable backend and prefer JavaScript.

## 7. Storage & Hosting
### AWS S3 (to store media, generated videos, and user files)
- Easy to store large files, images, and videos securely.
- Ideal for serving static files (e.g., final video downloads).

### Cloudinary (for media storage and optimization)
- Specialized in image and video hosting, with CDN support for fast delivery.

### Firebase/Firestore (for user data and quick storage)
- Firebase can handle user authentication, video metadata, and script storage.

### Heroku or Render (for app deployment)
- Easy to deploy your backend and front end for the MVP. Can scale easily if your app grows.

## 8. Video Format & Publishing
### YouTube API (for uploading videos automatically)
- Use the API to upload the generated YouTube Shorts directly from your app.
- Make sure your video is in the 9:16 aspect ratio (1080x1920) to meet YouTube Shorts specs.

## ðŸ›  Recommended Tech Stack for MVP
- **Frontend/UI**: Streamlit or React.js
- **Text Analysis**: GPT-4 (OpenAI API) + spaCy (for NLP)
- **Media Search**: Pexels API / Pixabay API
- **Voiceover**: ElevenLabs or gTTS
- **Video Editing**: MoviePy + FFmpeg
- **Backend**: Flask (or FastAPI)
- **Storage**: AWS S3 or Cloudinary
- **Video Publishing**: YouTube API
