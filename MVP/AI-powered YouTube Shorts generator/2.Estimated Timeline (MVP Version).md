### 🧑‍💻 Total Time to MVP (Solo Dev):
⏱️ Around **10–14 days** with focused effort  
(or faster with some help from me 👀)

## ⚡ Want to Go Faster?

If you want:
- A rapid prototype in **3–4 days**, you can skip advanced UI and just go **CLI + Streamlit**
- Me to generate the **boilerplate code** for each module, just say the word
- Help with **hosting and deployment** (e.g., **Render**, **Hugging Face Spaces**, or **Replit**), I’ve got you

---

## Would you like me to:
- Start building the **core modules** for you (scene analyzer, video generator)?
- Set up a **GitHub repo layout**?
- Help plan a **launch-ready V1** after MVP?

This idea has **HUGE potential**, and with the right MVP, you could attract **early users**, feedback, or even **funding** 💡💰
