# Why Ansible? What Problems Does It Solve?

- Ansible addresses common pain points in manual system administration, configuration drift,
and app deployment by automating these tasks reliably and repeatably.

# ‚úÖ Problems Solved by Ansible
## 1. Manual Configuration is Time-Consuming and Error-Prone
- Problem: Configuring servers by hand leads to inconsistency and human error.

- Ansible Solution: Define the desired system state in a YAML playbook and apply it across systems reliably.

## 2. Configuration Drift
- Problem: Over time, environments (e.g., dev, staging, prod) start to differ unexpectedly.

- Ansible Solution: Ensures all systems are in sync by applying the same configuration every time (idempotent).

## 3. No Centralized Automation
- Problem: Admins run scripts manually or use ad-hoc tools.

- Ansible Solution: Provides a centralized, structured, and repeatable way to automate tasks like user creation, package installation, and service configuration.

## 4. Complex Multi-Step Deployments
- Problem: Deploying an app often requires coordinated steps across multiple servers.

- Ansible Solution: Orchestrates multi-host workflows in one playbook (e.g., updating database, app servers, and load balancer together).

## 5. Agent Overhead
- Problem: Tools like Puppet or Chef require agents installed on each node.

- Ansible Solution: Agentless ‚Äì it connects over SSH, reducing maintenance and complexity.

## 6. Difficult Onboarding for New Team Members
- Problem: Hard to understand complex scripts or undocumented processes.

- Ansible Solution: Human-readable YAML playbooks make it easy for anyone to understand or contribute.

## üõ†Ô∏è Example Tasks Automated by Ansible:
- Install Apache/Nginx

- Start/stop services

- Set up users and SSH keys

- Deploy Docker containers

- Patch operating systems

- Configure firewalls
