# ✅ Why Ansible is Needed at the Initial Stage (Even in Small Projects)
1. Avoid Manual Errors

    - Setting up servers manually can lead to inconsistent environments.

    - Ansible ensures repeatable, reliable configurations from Day 1.

2. Speed Up Setup

    - You don’t waste time doing the same setup again and again (like installing packages, creating users, setting file permissions, etc.).

3. Keep Environments Consistent

   - Dev, test, and prod environments can be set up exactly the same way.

4. Version-Controlled Infrastructure

   - Playbooks are just YAML files — they can be versioned in Git, reviewed, and shared with teams.
