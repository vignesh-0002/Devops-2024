# 📄 Automated Node.js Installation on Windows, Linux, and macOS with Ansible

## 🧾 Overview

This document shows how to use one Ansible playbook to install Node.js on multiple OS types:

- Windows  
- Linux (e.g., Ubuntu, CentOS)  
- macOS  

---

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

- Ansible Control Machine (Linux/macOS recommended)
- Target machines:
  - Windows (WinRM enabled)
  - Linux (SSH enabled)
  - macOS (SSH enabled)
- Proper inventory file and authentication (SSH keys or passwords, or WinRM credentials)
- Python installed on all targets (Ansible needs this for Linux/macOS)

---

## 📂 Inventory Example (`inventory.ini`)

```ini
[linux]
192.168.1.10 ansible_user=ubuntu

[mac]
192.168.1.11 ansible_user=admin

[windows]
192.168.1.12 ansible_user=Administrator ansible_password=yourpassword ansible_connection=winrm ansible_winrm_transport=basic ansible_port=5986 ansible_winrm_server_cert_validation=ignore
```
## 📜 Playbook: install_node.yml

```Pla
- name: Install Node.js on Multiple OS Types
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:

    - name: Install Node.js on Debian-based Linux
      apt:
        name: nodejs
        state: present
      when: ansible_os_family == "Debian"

    - name: Install npm on Debian-based Linux
      apt:
        name: npm
        state: present
      when: ansible_os_family == "Debian"

    - name: Install Node.js on RedHat-based Linux
      yum:
        name: nodejs
        state: present
      when: ansible_os_family == "RedHat"

    - name: Install Node.js via Homebrew on macOS
      homebrew:
        name: node
        state: present
      when: ansible_system == "Darwin"

    - name: Install Node.js on Windows
      win_chocolatey:
        name: nodejs
        state: present
      when: ansible_os_family == "Windows"
```

## 🧪 How to Run It

```
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini install_node.yml
```

## 📌 Notes
- For macOS, Ansible uses the homebrew module. Homebrew must be installed beforehand.

- For Windows, Ansible uses the win_chocolatey module. Chocolatey should be pre-installed, or you can add a task to install it.

- You can add node --version checks as post-install validation using command or win_command.
