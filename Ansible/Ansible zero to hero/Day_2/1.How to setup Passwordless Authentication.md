# üîê Setting Up Passwordless SSH Authentication Between EC2 Instances for Ansible

- Passwordless SSH is essential for Ansible to communicate with remote EC2 instances without requiring manual password entry. Below are the commonly used methods:

# ‚úÖ Prerequisites
- Ansible control node (can be an EC2 instance)

- One or more target EC2 instances (managed nodes)

- SSH access to all instances

- Open port 22 in the Security Groups of target EC2s

- Same VPC or peering for network access (if required)

## üîß Method 1: SSH Key Pair Method (Recommended)

 ### Step 1: Generate SSH Key Pair on Ansible Control Node

  ```
      ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "ansible@ec2"
  ```

   - Press Enter to accept the default path (~/.ssh/id_rsa)

   - Do not enter a passphrase for passwordless access

  ### Step 2: Copy Public Key to Managed Nodes

  - Use ssh-copy-id (install it via sudo apt install sshpass on Debian/Ubuntu if not available):

  ```
  ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ec2-user@<target-ec2-ip>
  ```

  - If ssh-copy-id is not available, use:

  ```
  cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh ec2-user@<target-ec2-ip> 'mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys && chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys'
  ```

  ### Step 3: Verify Passwordless Access
   ```
    ssh ec2-user@<target-ec2-ip>
   ```
  ### Step 4: Configure Ansible Inventory

   ```
   [webservers]
   192.168.1.10 ansible_user=ec2-user ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/id_rsa
   ```

 ## üîÑ Method 2: Use EC2 Key Pair (If All Nodes Share the Same Key)

1. Ensure all EC2 instances are launched with the same key pair.

2. Use that private key (.pem file) as the Ansible SSH key:

  ```
   [all]
   192.168.1.10 ansible_user=ec2-user ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/Downloads/my-key.pem
  ```

üí° Note: You still need to set proper permissions:

 ```
  chmod 400 my-key.pem

 ```

## üß∞ Method 3: Use Bastion Host (Jump Box)

- If EC2 targets are in a private subnet:

  1. SSH into the bastion host using the private key.

  2. Use ansible_ssh_common_args to proxy through:
 
   ```
   [private-nodes]
   10.0.2.10 ansible_user=ec2-user ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/id_rsa ansible_ssh_common_args='-o ProxyCommand="ssh -W %h:%p -q ec2-user@<bastion-ip>"'

   ```

### üîê Security Best Practices

- Never expose private keys in source control.

- Use a separate key pair for Ansible automation.

- Limit SSH access with security group rules.

- Use SSH Agent Forwarding sparingly and securely.

   
# ‚úÖ Final Test
- Run a basic Ansible ping to ensure connectivity:
  ``` 
   ansible all -m ping
  ```
