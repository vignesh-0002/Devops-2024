# Introduction
## What is containerization?

- In today's fast-paced software development landscape, containerization has become a game-changer,
   enabling efficient application deployment and management across various environments. By encapsulating application code along with its dependencies,
   libraries, and packages, containerization ensures consistency, making applications highly portable and scalable.

- Containers are lightweight because they share the OS and kernel of the host machine, eliminating the need to run a full OS for each applicationâ€”unlike
  traditional virtual machines (VMs). This streamlined approach enhances resource efficiency while simplifying deployment across cloud, on-premise, and hybrid environments.

- With its ability to support microservices architecture and accelerate DevOps workflows, containerization has become a crucial component in modern software development,
  driving innovation and operational efficiency across industries.
