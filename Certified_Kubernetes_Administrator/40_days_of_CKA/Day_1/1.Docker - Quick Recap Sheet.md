# 🚢 Docker - Quick Recap Sheet

## 📦 What is Docker?
- Open-source platform to automate application deployment in lightweight **containers**.
- Ensures consistency across multiple development & production environments.
- Think of it as a shipping container for your code.

## 🧱 Containers vs Virtual Machines

| Feature          | Containers                     | Virtual Machines              |
|------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| OS               | Share Host OS                  | Each has its own OS           |
| Resource Usage   | Lightweight                    | Heavy (includes guest OS)     |
| Startup Time     | Seconds                        | Minutes                        |
| Isolation        | Process-level isolation        | Full hardware-level isolation |

## 🏠 Building & House Analogy
- **VMs**: Entire houses with foundation, plumbing, etc.
- **Containers**: Apartment units in the same building sharing structure.
- Result: Containers are **more efficient** and **easier to manage**.

---

## 😩 Challenges with Non-Containerized Apps
- "It works on my machine" issues.
- Dependency conflicts.
- Heavyweight VMs slow down testing/dev cycles.
- Difficult to scale consistently.

---

## ✅ How Docker Solves It
- Bundles app + dependencies in one image.
- Runs anywhere (Dev, Test, Prod) the same way.
- Lightweight → Faster CI/CD & deployment.
- Easier rollback, scaling, and versioning.

## 😆 That's how Docker was born  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1224fa56-222f-44d0-8261-a30f491a95f3)

> *(Just kidding!)* But seriously, it revolutionized DevOps.

## 🔁 Simple Docker Workflow
1. Write `Dockerfile`
2. Build Docker Image → `docker build`
3. Run Container → `docker run`
4. Push to Registry → `docker push`
5. Pull & Deploy → `docker pull && docker run`

## 🏗️ Docker Architecture

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b60d1f44-fd0f-4f70-9866-83cf3b24b3c7)

**Key Components:**
- **Docker Client**: Sends commands.
- **Docker Daemon**: Builds, runs containers.
- **Docker Images**: Read-only templates.
- **Docker Containers**: Running instances of images.
- **Docker Registry**: Stores and distributes images (e.g., Docker Hub).

---

## ✅ Tips for Interview/Exam
- Know difference b/w **images**, **containers**, **volumes**, **networks**.
- Understand `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`.
- Be able to write a simple Dockerfile.
- Know how to list, start, stop, remove containers/images.
