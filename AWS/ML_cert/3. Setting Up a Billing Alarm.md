## Setting Up a Billing Alarm

If you choose to follow along with the **hands-on activities** in this course, it's a good idea to set up a **billing alarm**. This ensures you don't inadvertently leave something up and running that could **cost you money**.

If you follow the instructions and clean up after yourself as we demonstrate, it **shouldn't cost more than a couple of bucks** to complete the course. However, it's all too easy to leave a resource running by mistake and get hit with a **surprising AWS bill**.

### Why Set Up a Billing Alarm?

To avoid unexpected charges, take a moment to:

1. **Go to your AWS Console**
2. **Search for "Billing"**
3. Navigate to **Budgets and Planning** → **Budgets**
4. Click on **Create a Budget**

### Budget Setup Options

- If you’re not comfortable spending anything, choose the **Zero Spend Budget** template.  
  > Note: You won’t be able to do the hands-on parts of the course with this setting.
- If you want to participate in the hands-on labs, set a **Monthly Cost Budget**:
  - Enter the amount you're comfortable spending (e.g., `$20`)
  - Specify the **email address** where you'd like to receive alerts

### How It Helps

Once set up, if your expenses **exceed your threshold**, AWS will **send you an email notification**. This gives you a chance to:

- Investigate what’s running
- Shut down forgotten resources
- Prevent further charges

Setting up a budget is a **simple and smart precaution** to protect yourself from unnecessary costs. It only takes a minute, and it could **save you from a much larger bill** later.

Take a moment now and set up that billing alarm—you’ll be glad you did.
