## ☁️ Uploading an Object

1. Go into the new bucket
2. Click **Upload**
3. Click **Add files**
4. Choose `coffee.jpeg`
5. Review **Storage Class options** under **Properties**

## 📦 Available Storage Classes

You’ll see a wide range of storage classes in AWS:

| Storage Class                | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Standard**                | Default class for frequently accessed data                                  |
| **Intelligent-Tiering**     | Ideal if access patterns are unpredictable; AWS auto-tiers data             |
| **Standard-IA**             | Infrequently accessed data, still with low latency                          |
| **One Zone-IA**             | Data stored in one AZ; suitable for re-creatable data                       |
| **Glacier Instant Retrieval** | Archived data with milliseconds retrieval                                  |
| **Glacier Flexible Retrieval** | Archived data, 1 min to 12 hrs retrieval                                 |
| **Glacier Deep Archive**    | Long-term archive, retrieval takes 12–48 hrs                                |
| **Reduced Redundancy**      | Deprecated; not recommended                                                 |

## 🔁 Changing Storage Class After Upload

- Upload `coffee.jpeg` with **Standard-IA** class
- After upload, go to **Object Properties**
- Scroll down to **Storage Class** and click **Edit**
- Change to `One Zone-IA` → **Save Changes**
- Confirm that object is now listed under One Zone-IA

You can repeat this:
- Edit and change to **Glacier Instant Retrieval**
- Or switch to **Intelligent-Tiering** for auto-tiering based on usage

## ⚙️ Automating Storage Class Transitions

### Step-by-step: Lifecycle Rule Setup

1. Go back to your bucket
2. Navigate to the **Management** tab
3. Click **Create lifecycle rule**
4. Rule name: `demo-rule`
5. Apply to: **All objects in the bucket**
6. Configure transitions:
    - Move to **Standard-IA** after **30 days**
    - Move to **Intelligent-Tiering** after **60 days**
    - Move to **Glacier Flexible Retrieval** after **180 days**

> These transitions will automatically move objects across storage classes based on age.

---

## ✅ Summary

- You can **choose** or **change** the storage class of S3 objects manually
- Use **lifecycle rules** to automate transitions over time
- Each class is optimized for specific **cost**, **latency**, and **durability** needs
- AWS provides **flexibility and control** over object storage strategies

🎓 That’s it for this demo on **S3 Storage Classes**.  
See you in the next lecture!
