# üéØ Setting Expectations for the AWS Certified Machine Learning Specialty Exam

Let's begin by setting some expectations.

The **AWS Certified Machine Learning ‚Äì Specialty** exam isn't like any other AWS exam.

If you've taken other AWS certifications, you probably expect to be tested on extremely deep knowledge of AWS services and how to architect systems comprised of those services to solve specific problems.

When it comes to the **AWS SageMaker** service, that much is still true on the machine learning exam. You'll need a lot of depth on SageMaker‚Äîhow it integrates with other systems, how to secure it, and low-level details on how its many built-in algorithms work.

## ‚ùó But Here's What's Different...

What's weird about this exam is that **it's not all about AWS**.

About **half of the exam isn't about AWS at all**.  
It tests your **general machine learning knowledge**:

- How do deep neural networks work?
- What sorts of algorithms should you choose for specific problems?
- How do you tune those algorithms for best results?

A lot of what this exam tests has nothing to do with AWS directly.

## üß† Real-World ML Experience Required

What's also unusual is that the exam seems designed to challenge people **without real industry experience** in machine learning.

You‚Äôll be tested on:

- Nuances of tuning models
- Identifying and preventing overfitting
- Scaling models to massive datasets

These are **not covered** in many beginner ML courses.  
They're usually learned **on the job**.

This course will attempt to **bridge that gap**, diving deep into topics like **regularization** and **hyperparameter tuning** often overlooked elsewhere.

> üí¨ "I've heard stories of seasoned AWS experts walking out of this exam asking themselves: *What the heck was that?*"

You **can‚Äôt rely on AWS expertise alone**. You must also be a **genuine ML expert**.

We‚Äôre going to do our best to get you there.

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ ML Implementation and Operations ‚Äì *20% of the Exam*

This section focuses heavily on **SageMaker operations**.

Topics include:

- Custom training models using containers
- Security configurations in SageMaker
- Selecting right instance types
- Performing live A/B testing
- Integrations with other platforms (e.g. TensorFlow)
- Pushing models to the edge using:
  - SageMaker Neo
  - AWS GreenGrass
- Using **Pipes** to speed up training
- **Elastic inference** & **Inference pipelines**

---

## üèÅ Final Steps

Once you've gone through all this material, it‚Äôs time to:

- Take **practice exams**
- Review weak areas
- Schedule the **real exam**
- üèÜ Earn your **AWS Machine Learning Specialty Certificate**

---

## üí¨ Final Thoughts

There‚Äôs a **lot to learn and digest**, but we‚Äôve done our best to focus only on the material that‚Äôs **relevant to this certification**.

If you can:

‚úÖ Master the course content  
‚úÖ Pass the practice exams  

You should be in **great shape** to take on the real exam.
