## Amazon S3 Storage Classes

In this section, we'll explore the **different storage classes** available in Amazon S3. These are critical for optimizing storage costs and ensuring data durability and availability.

---

### 📦 Storage Classes Overview

1. **Amazon S3 Standard – General Purpose**
2. **Amazon S3 Standard – Infrequent Access (IA)**
3. **Amazon S3 One Zone – Infrequent Access**
4. **Amazon S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval**
5. **Amazon S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval**
6. **Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive**
7. **Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering**

You **must know these for the AWS Machine Learning exam**.

You can:
- Choose a storage class when uploading an object
- Modify an object’s storage class manually
- Use **S3 Lifecycle Configurations** to **automatically transition objects** between classes

## 🧠 Key Concepts

### Durability
- Defined as the likelihood of **data loss**.
- All S3 storage classes offer **11 nines** durability: `99.999999999%`
- This means losing **1 object per 10 million** every **10,000 years**

### Availability
- Defined as the **readiness** or **uptime** of the service.
- Varies by storage class.

## 🏷️ Storage Classes Explained

### 🔹 S3 Standard – General Purpose
- **Availability**: `99.99%`
- **Use Cases**: Frequently accessed data
- **Features**:
  - Low latency
  - High throughput
  - Sustains **2 AZ failures**
- **Examples**: Big data analytics, mobile & gaming apps, content distribution

---

### 🔹 S3 Standard – Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)
- **Availability**: `99.9%`
- **Use Cases**: Disaster recovery, backups
- **Features**:
  - Lower cost than Standard
  - **Retrieval cost applies**

---

### 🔹 S3 One Zone – Infrequent Access (One Zone-IA)
- **Availability**: `99.5%`
- **Stored in a single AZ only**
- **Use Cases**: Secondary backups, re-creatable data
- **Risk**: Data loss if the AZ is destroyed

## 📊 Comparison Overview (Optional)

You **don’t need to memorize** the numbers, but it's helpful to understand:

- All storage classes provide **11 9's durability**
- **Availability** decreases with fewer availability zones
- **Storage duration minimums** vary by class
- Pricing varies across classes (e.g., in `us-east-1`)

👉 **Tip**: Focus on **understanding use cases** over memorizing specs.

---

## ✅ Summary

- Learn the **use cases and behaviors** of each S3 storage class
- Use **S3 Lifecycle Rules** to automate transitions
- **Durability is consistent**, but **availability and costs vary**
- **Glacier tiers** are for cold storage with varying retrieval time and costs
- **S3 Intelligent-Tiering** simplifies class management for unpredictable access patterns
