## Data Engineering

The first domain we'll cover is **data engineering**.

You'll find that in practice, you spend a lot of time just **collecting and processing the data** you need to train your machine learning algorithms. Often, this is a **larger effort than building the machine learning algorithms themselves**.

The challenge is to get your data where it needs to be for training your models in a manner that can deal with:

- **Massive scale**
- **Strict security requirements**

For this section, I'm handing things off to **Stephane Marek**, who is:

- A recognized expert in **AWS storage solutions**
- A **certified AWS Solutions Architect**
- A very popular instructor in the world of **AWS certification**

So take it away, Stephane, and walk us through the world of **data engineering in AWS**.
