# Amazon FSx - Fully Managed High-Performance File Systems on AWS

## 🧩 What is Amazon FSx?

Amazon FSx allows you to **launch and run third-party high-performance file systems on AWS** as fully managed services. It is to **file systems** what **RDS** is to databases. Just like you can launch MySQL or PostgreSQL on RDS, you can launch:

- **Windows File Server**
- **Lustre**
- **NetApp ONTAP**
- **OpenZFS**

> Note: This list may expand over time, so always check the AWS documentation for updates.
