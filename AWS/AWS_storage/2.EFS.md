# Amazon EFS (Elastic File System)

Hi, and welcome to this lecture on **Amazon EFS (Elastic File System).**

---

## What is EFS?

- **EFS** is a **managed NFS (Network File System)**.
- It can be **mounted on many EC2 instances**, even across **different availability zones (AZs)**.
- Key benefits:
  - Highly **available**
  - Very **scalable**
  - **Expensive** (≈ 3x cost of a GP2 EBS volume)
  - **Pay-per-use** model — no need to provision capacity in advance.

---

## EFS Architecture

- You create an **EFS file system** and associate it with a **security group**.
- EC2 instances in different AZs (e.g., `us-east-1a`, `us-east-1b`, `us-east-1c`) can **connect to the same EFS**.
- EFS supports **concurrent access** across multiple EC2 instances.

---

## Use Cases

- **Content management**
- **Web serving**
- **Data sharing**
- **WordPress hosting**

---

## Key Features

- Uses **NFS protocol**
- Controlled via **security groups**
- **Linux-only** compatibility (not compatible with Windows)
- **Encryption at rest** with KMS
- POSIX-compliant and supports standard file API
- **Automatic scaling** — no planning required

---

## Performance and Storage Classes

### Scale

- Supports **thousands of NFS clients**
- **10+ GBps throughput**
- Grows to **petabyte scale** automatically

### Performance Modes (set at creation)

| Mode            | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| **General Purpose** | Default; for latency-sensitive workloads like web servers or CMS |
| **Max I/O**         | Higher latency but greater throughput; good for big data or media processing |

### Throughput Modes

| Mode          | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Bursting**     | Scales with storage; e.g., 1 TB = 50 MBps + burst to 100 MBps |
| **Provisioned**  | Fixed throughput regardless of storage size |
| **Elastic**      | Automatically adjusts throughput; e.g., up to 3 GBps (read), 1 GBps (write) |

## Storage Classes & Lifecycle Management

### Tiers

| Tier             | Use Case |
|------------------|----------|
| **Standard**     | Frequently accessed files |
| **EFS-IA**       | Infrequently accessed files (lower cost, retrieval fee) |
| **Archive**      | Rarely accessed data (cheapest storage) |

### Lifecycle Policies

- Automatically **move files** between tiers based on **last accessed time**.
- Example:
  - File in Standard tier **not accessed for 60 days** → Moved to **EFS-IA**.

## Availability and Durability

| Option             | Use Case |
|--------------------|----------|
| **Multi-AZ (Standard)** | Great for production workloads, disaster resistance |
| **One Zone**           | Cheaper; good for dev environments |
| **One Zone-IA**        | Combines cost savings of IA with One Zone setup |

> Using appropriate EFS classes and policies can help **save up to 90% in storage costs**.
