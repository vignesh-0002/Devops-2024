# 📘 Summary of Amazon Aurora

Amazon Aurora is a **fully managed relational database** that is **API-compatible** with **PostgreSQL** and **MySQL**.

---

## 🔧 Architecture Overview

### Storage:
- Data is **stored in six replicas across three Availability Zones (AZs)** by default.
- This setup provides **high availability** and **fault tolerance**.
- **Self-healing storage** mechanisms automatically repair issues behind the scenes.
- **Auto-scaling storage**—you don’t need to manually increase it.

### Compute:
- Compute consists of **database instances in a cluster**.
- You can **distribute instances across multiple AZs**.
- Supports **read replicas** for horizontal read scaling.
- **Custom endpoints** are used:
  - **Writer Endpoint**: For write operations
  - **Reader Endpoint**: For read operations

---

## 🔒 Security, 🔍 Monitoring & 🔧 Maintenance
- Shares the same **security**, **monitoring**, and **maintenance features** as Amazon RDS.
- Backup and restore options are available but discussed in detail in separate sections.

---

## 🌟 Key Features

### Aurora Serverless:
- Designed for **unpredictable or intermittent workloads**.
- Automatically adjusts compute capacity.
- No need for manual capacity planning.

### Aurora Global Database:
- Replicate your database **across multiple AWS regions**.
- Up to **16 read replicas per region**.
- **Sub-second latency** for cross-region replication.
- Supports **promotion of a secondary region** to primary for disaster recovery.

### Aurora Machine Learning:
- Integrate with **SageMaker** and **Amazon Comprehend** to perform ML inference directly within the database.

### Aurora Database Cloning:
- Quickly create a **testing/staging environment** from your production DB.
- Much **faster than snapshot and restore**.

---

## 📌 Use Cases
- Same as Amazon RDS (OLTP workloads, SQL queries, transactional apps).
- **Less maintenance**, **better performance**, **higher scalability**, and **richer features** than RDS.
