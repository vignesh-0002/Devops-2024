# Introduction to AWS Databases

Hello, and welcome to this section on **databases**.

This is a quick introduction because in the **AWS certification exam**, you'll often need to **choose the right database for a given workload**. AWS offers a wide variety of **managed database services**, and your choice depends on the **architecture** and **requirements** described in the question.

## 🧠 Key Questions to Ask

- Is the workload **write-heavy**, **read-heavy**, or **balanced**?
- Does the workload **change or fluctuate** during the day?
- How much data will be stored, and for how long?
- Will the dataset **grow over time**?
- What is the **average object size**?
- How often is the data **accessed**, and in what patterns?
- What level of **data durability** is required?
- What is the **source of truth** for your data?
- Are there any **latency requirements**?
- Are there **concurrent user** requirements?
- What is the **data model**?
- How will you **query the data**? Will you need **joins**?
- Is the data:
  - **Structured**?
  - **Semi-structured**?
- Do you need a **strong schema**, or is **schema flexibility** important?
- Do you need to include **reporting** on top of your database?
- Do you need **search capabilities**?
- Do you prefer a **relational database** or **NoSQL**?
- Are there any **licensing costs** involved?
- Do you want to use **cloud-native databases** like **Aurora**, etc.?

These are the **dimensions and decision factors** you'll be presented with in exam questions to help determine the most suitable database.

## 📚 Categories of AWS Managed Databases

Don't worry — we'll cover each of these in detail later. Here's a quick overview of what's coming:

### 1. **Relational Databases (RDBMS)**
Use case: SQL-based applications and **Online Transaction Processing (OLTP)**.
- ✅ Great for complex queries and **joins**
- Services:
  - **Amazon RDS** (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, MariaDB)
  - **Amazon Aurora**

### 2. **NoSQL Databases**
Use case: Schema-less data, high scalability, and flexibility.
- ❌ Typically no joins or traditional SQL
- Services:
  - **DynamoDB**
  - **ElastiCache**
  - **Neptune** (Graph)
  - **DocumentDB** (MongoDB-compatible)
  - **Keyspaces** (Cassandra-compatible)

### 3. **Object Storage (for Large Binary Data)**
- Use case: Storing big files and backups
- Services:
  - **Amazon S3** (frequent access)
  - **Amazon S3 Glacier** (cold storage/archives)

### 4. **Data Warehousing**
Use case: **Analytics**, **BI**, **OLAP**, and running SQL over massive datasets.
- Services:
  - **Amazon Redshift**
  - **Amazon Athena**
  - **Amazon EMR**

### 5. **Search Databases**
Use case: **Full-text search**, **log analytics**, **unstructured search**
- Service:
  - **Amazon OpenSearch**

### 6. **Graph Databases**
Use case: Represent and query **relationships** between datasets
- Service:
  - **Amazon Neptune**

### 7. **Ledger Databases**
Use case: Maintain a **cryptographically verifiable** record of transactions
- Service:
  - **Amazon QLDB** (Quantum Ledger Database)

### 8. **Time Series Databases**
Use case: **Time-stamped data** like metrics, logs, and IoT
- Service:
  - **Amazon Timestream**

## ✅ Final Notes

- More database types may be introduced as AWS evolves.
- If any databases are not covered in this section, they will be included in the **Data and Analytics** section.
- You **don’t need to memorize** everything right now. This is just a **high-level overview** to orient you before we dive deeper into each service.
