## 🚀 Launching a Web Server Container on AWS Fargate

Now that we’ve created an IAM user with the required permissions, it’s time to launch a containerized web server using **Amazon ECS with AWS Fargate**.

---

### 🔑 Step 1: Log in with IAM User

- Log in to the [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/) using the IAM user you created (e.g., `ecs-course`).
- Choose your **preferred AWS region** (ideally, the one closest to you).

---

### 🐳 Step 2: Access Elastic Container Service (ECS)

- In the AWS console search bar, type **ECS** and select **Elastic Container Service**.
- You may see two UI experiences:
  - **New ECS Experience**
  - **Old ECS Console** (some features may still require this)
- For this walkthrough, use the **old console experience** if prompted.

---

### 📦 Step 3: Get Started with ECS Setup

- Click **Get Started** to initiate the container setup wizard.
- This will walk you through:
  - Container definition
  - Task definition
  - Service
  - Cluster

---

### 🔧 Step 4: Define the Container

- Choose the **Nginx** image.
- Default CPU and memory settings will be pre-filled (minimal resources).
- Ensure:
  - **Launch type**: `Fargate`
  - **Network mode**: `awsvpc` (for Fargate)
- **Task Definition Name**: Rename from `first-run-task-definition` to something meaningful (e.g., `quickstart-nginx-td`).

---

### ⚙️ Step 5: Configure the Service

- **Service Name**: e.g., `quickstart-nginx-svc`
- **Number of Tasks**: `1`
- **Security Group**: Allow inbound traffic on **port 80**
- **Load Balancer**: Select **None**

---

### 🏗️ Step 6: Configure the Cluster

- **Cluster Name**: e.g., `quickstart-nginx-cluster`
- Let ECS auto-create the **VPC, subnets, and related networking components**.

---

### 🔍 Step 7: Review and Launch

- Review all settings (task, service, cluster).
- Click **Create**.
- AWS will now provision all resources (may take up to 10 minutes).

---

### ✅ Step 8: Verify the Deployment

- Once completed, click **View Service**.
- Navigate to:
  - **Service details**
  - **Tasks** → Click the running task
- Look for the **Public IP Address** of the task.
- Open it in your browser:  
  You should see the **default Nginx welcome page**.

---

### 🧹 Step 9: Clean Up Resources

To avoid unnecessary charges:

1. Go to **Services**
2. Select your service
3. Click **Delete** → Confirm
4. After deletion, go to **Tasks** and ensure none are running
5. The **cluster** can remain, but it will have no services or tasks

---

### 🎉 Success!

You've successfully deployed and tested a web server on **AWS Fargate** using **Amazon ECS**. This is the foundation for running containerized apps in a serverless fashion.

> This setup is ideal for learning ECS concepts, and will scale as we progress in the course.
