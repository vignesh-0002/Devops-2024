# ECS vs EKS vs Beanstalk

All right.

Now let‚Äôs talk about **ECS vs EKS vs Beanstalk**, so you understand the differences before diving deeper into the course.

---

## üê≥ ECS (Elastic Container Service)

- ECS is what we‚Äôve been using (and will continue using) in this course.
- It allows you to run **Docker containers** on AWS-managed infrastructure.
- ECS is a **proprietary** service by AWS ‚Äî meaning it‚Äôs tightly controlled by AWS.
- **Pros:**
  - Deep integration with other AWS services (IAM, CloudWatch, ALB, etc.).
  - Easy to use, especially with the **Fargate launch type** (serverless).
- **Launch Types:**
  - **EC2** ‚Äì Run containers on user-managed EC2 instances.
  - **Fargate** ‚Äì Run containers without managing any infrastructure.

## ‚ò∏Ô∏è EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)

- EKS is Docker and **Kubernetes** on AWS.
- If you have experience with Kubernetes, **EKS is a great option**.
- EKS supports both **EC2** and **Fargate** launch types.
- **Pros:**
  - Leverages **open-source tooling** (i.e., Kubernetes).
  - Offers greater flexibility and portability across cloud providers.
- **Recommendation:**
  - If you‚Äôre **new to containers on AWS**, stick with **ECS** for now.
  - If you‚Äôre experienced with **Kubernetes**, consider **EKS**.

## üå± AWS Elastic Beanstalk

- Beanstalk is a **Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)**.
- It‚Äôs designed to quickly deploy applications in:
  - **Java**, **Node.js**, **Python**, **.NET/C#**, and more.
- It supports both **single** and **multi-container Docker** apps.
- **Uses ECS under the hood**, but abstracts away most of the complexity.
- **Pros:**
  - Great for simple or monolithic apps.
  - Minimal customization needed to deploy.

## ‚úÖ Summary

| Service     | Container Support | Abstraction Level | Customization | Best For                        |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------|---------------------------------|
| **ECS**     | Docker            | Medium            | Moderate      | Beginners, AWS integrations     |
| **EKS**     | Docker + K8s      | Low               | High          | Kubernetes experts              |
| **Beanstalk**| Docker (optional) | High              | Low           | Simple apps, fast deployments   |

We‚Äôll be focusing on **ECS** throughout this course, but it‚Äôs important to understand how it compares to EKS and Beanstalk.

Thanks for watching this lecture ‚Äî see you in the next one!
