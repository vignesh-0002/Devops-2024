# AWS VPC Infrastructure Overview

## Components

| Resource Type              | Count | Description                                           |
|---------------------------|-------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `aws_vpc`                 | 1     | Virtual Private Cloud with CIDR block `10.0.0.0/16`. |
| `aws_subnet`              | 4     | 2 Public + 2 Private subnets across 2 AZs.           |
| `aws_internet_gateway`    | 1     | Provides internet access to public subnets.          |
| `aws_nat_gateway`         | 1     | Enables outbound internet for private subnets.       |
| `aws_eip`                 | 1     | Elastic IP for the NAT gateway.                      |
| `aws_route_table`         | 2     | 1 for public, 1 for private routes.                  |
| `aws_route_table_association` | 4 | Associates subnets with respective route tables.     |

## Workflow / Architecture Flow
1. VPC Created with CIDR `10.0.0.0/16`.

2. Public Subnets in `us-east-1a` and `us-east-1b` created:
    - Associated with an Internet Gateway.
    - Instances launched here get public IPs and direct internet access.

3. Private Subnets in both AZs:
    - Have no direct internet access.
    - Route internet traffic through a `NAT Gateway` in a public subnet.

4. Route Tables:
    - Public Route Table: Directs `0.0.0.0/0` via `Internet Gateway`.
    - Private Route Table: Directs `0.0.0.0/0` via `NAT Gateway`.


## Estimated Monthly Cost

| Resource            | Estimated Cost                |
|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| VPC & Subnets       | $0                            |
| Internet Gateway    | $0                            |
| Elastic IP (EIP)    | ~$3.60                        |
| NAT Gateway         | ~$32.40 + data transfer       |
| **Total (approx.)** | **~$36+/mo**                  |

Note: NAT Gateway incurs $0.045/hour and $0.045/GB data processed. Costs may rise depending on usage.

# üõ°Ô∏è AWS IAM Setup for ECS using Terraform
This Terraform script provisions the necessary AWS IAM roles, policies, and instance profiles required for running Amazon ECS using both EC2 and Fargate launch types.

## ‚úÖ IAM Roles, Policies, and Instance Profile

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ aws_iam_role.ecs_instance_role  
**Purpose**: IAM role that EC2 instances assume to communicate with ECS and other AWS services.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ aws_iam_role_policy_attachment.ecs_instance_role_policy  
**Purpose**: Attaches the AWS-managed policy `AmazonEC2ContainerServiceforEC2Role` to the EC2 IAM role, enabling ECS container instance functionality.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ aws_iam_instance_profile.ecs_instance_profile  
**Purpose**: Allows the EC2 IAM role to be attached to ECS container instances when launching them.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ aws_iam_role.ecs_task_execution_role  
**Purpose**: IAM role that ECS tasks assume at runtime to access required AWS services (e.g., ECR, CloudWatch, Secrets Manager).

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ aws_iam_role_policy_attachment.ecs_task_execution_policy  
**Purpose**: Attaches the AWS-managed policy `AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy` to the ECS task execution role, enabling ECS tasks to pull images, send logs, and access secrets.
