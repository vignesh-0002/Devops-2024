## Creating an IAM User and Launching a Web Server on Fargate

### Step 1: Create an IAM User

We begin by creating an IAM user with appropriate permissions for this course.

> **Note**: It is best practice to never use the root AWS account for regular tasks. Always create IAM users with specific permissions.

#### Instructions:

1. **Login to AWS Console**.
2. In the top search bar, type **IAM** and select **IAM - Manage access to AWS resources**.
3. Go to the **Users** section.
4. Click on **Add User**.

#### User Setup:

- **Username**: `ecs-course`
- **Access Type**:
  - ✅ Programmatic Access (gives Access Key ID & Secret Access Key)
  - ✅ AWS Management Console Access
- **Password**: Set a **custom password**

Click **Next**.

#### Permissions:

1. Choose **Attach existing policies directly**.
2. Search and select the following policy:
   - `AmazonECS_FullAccess`
3. (Optional) Click to view the policy and confirm it includes access to services like:
   - App Mesh
   - Auto Scaling
   - Cloud Map
   - and others related to ECS.

Click **Next**, skip adding tags, and proceed to **Review**.

#### Review and Create:

- Review the information
- Click **Create User**

Once created:

- You'll receive the **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key**
- Download the `.csv` file or email the credentials to yourself
- ⚠️ This is the **only time** you’ll be able to view the **Secret Access Key**, so store it safely.

Also, copy the **console sign-in link** under **Security credentials** → **Console Sign-In Link** for easier login later.

### Step 2: Add Admin Permissions (Optional but Recommended)

To ensure access to networking resources like **VPC**, **Subnets**, etc.:

1. Go back to the user’s page.
2. Click **Add Permissions** → **Attach Policies**.
3. Add: `AdministratorAccess` policy.

Click **Next** and **Add permissions**.

### Result

You now have an IAM user (`ecs-course`) with the required
