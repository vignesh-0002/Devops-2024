## Understanding ECS and Fargate

### What is ECS?

**ECS** stands for **Elastic Container Service**.

- ECS is used to launch **Docker containers** on AWS.
- The word "elastic" implies that it can **scale** based on demand.
- ECS has two launch types:
  - **EC2 launch type**
  - **Fargate launch type**

### ECS with EC2 Launch Type

- You **must provision and maintain** the infrastructure (EC2 instances) yourself.
- You are responsible for:
  - Adding/removing EC2 instances manually.
  - Managing updates and scaling.
- AWS ECS handles **starting and stopping containers** on your EC2 instances.
- You can integrate ECS with an **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**.
- ECS service will place containers intelligently across available EC2 instances.
- However, **scaling requires manually adding EC2 instances**.

### What is Fargate?

**Fargate** is a **serverless** compute engine for containers.

- You **don’t need to provision or manage EC2 instances**.
- AWS provisions the infrastructure **automatically in the backend**.
- You simply define:
  - The **CPU and memory** requirements.
  - The **Docker image** to run.
- AWS handles:
  - Launching the container.
  - Placing it on infrastructure.
  - Registering it with an ALB if needed.
- You **only pay for the resources you use**.

### Key Differences Between ECS Launch Types

| Feature                   | EC2 Launch Type                 | Fargate Launch Type             |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Infrastructure Management | You manage EC2 instances         | AWS manages infrastructure      |
| Serverless                | ❌ Manual provisioning required   | ✅ Fully serverless              |
| Scaling                   | Manual                           | Automatic                        |
| Use Case                  | Fine-grained control             | Simpler deployment, no overhead |

Now that you understand the difference between **Fargate** and **EC2** launch types, let’s put this into practice.
