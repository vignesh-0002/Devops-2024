# ECS Architecture and Instance Overview

## ECS Cluster and EC2 Instances

- ECS is essentially a **logical grouping of EC2 instances**.
- These EC2 instances run the **ECS agent** as a **Docker container**.
- A **cluster** can have **multiple instances** running simultaneously.
- Each EC2 instance:
  - Runs the ECS agent (as a container).
  - Registers itself with the ECS control plane.

## Role of ECS Agent

- The **ECS agent** is responsible for:
  - Connecting the EC2 instance to the ECS cluster.
  - Registering the instance with the ECS control plane.
  - Orchestrating containers inside the EC2 instance.
  - Sending CloudWatch logs and enabling service communication.

## Amazon Machine Image (AMI)

- EC2 instances use a **special ECS-optimized AMI** provided by AWS.
- This AMI is **pre-configured** for ECS, simplifying setup.

# Creating ECS Clusters

## Methods of Cluster Creation

You can create an ECS cluster using any of the following methods:

1. **AWS Management Console**
2. **AWS CLI**
3. **Infrastructure as Code** (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation)

> All methods produce the same result. Choose based on your preference.

## IAM Roles and Permissions

### EC2 Instance Role

- Allows the ECS agent to:
  - Register with the ECS cluster.
  - Communicate with other AWS services (e.g., CloudWatch).

### Task Role

- Used to grant permissions **to individual ECS tasks**.
- Example:
  - **Task A**: Needs access to **Amazon S3**, so it's given a specific role.
  - **Task B**: Needs to call an API or access EC2, so it's given a different role.
- These roles ensure tasks follow the **principle of least privilege**.

# ECS Networking and Architecture

## Course Architecture (Simplified for Cost and Learning)

- VPC with:
  - **1 Availability Zone**
  - **1 Public Subnet**
- ECS cluster is deployed inside the public subnet.
- Chosen for simplicity and cost-effectiveness.
- ⚠️ **Not recommended for production**.

## Production-Ready Architecture

- Recommended architecture includes:
  - **VPC**
  - **Multiple Availability Zones**
  - **Public and Private Subnets**
- ECS tasks and services run in **private subnets**.
- Communication with the internet uses:
  - **NAT Gateway** (for outbound access)
  - **Load Balancer** in public subnet (for inbound traffic)

### Architecture Flow

- **Private Subnet**:
  - ECS services/tasks
  - Outbound internet via NAT Gateway
- **Public Subnet**:
  - Load Balancer to route external traffic
- Secure and scalable but **more complex and expensive**.

> For this course, we'll use **public subnets only** to reduce cost and complexity.  
> In **production**, always use **private subnets** for ECS services.

# Summary

- ECS clusters group EC2 instances to run Docker containers.
- ECS agents manage instance registration and communication.
- IAM roles are essential for secure permissions and service access.
- Start with **public subnet architecture** for learning.
- Use **private subnet architecture** for production.
