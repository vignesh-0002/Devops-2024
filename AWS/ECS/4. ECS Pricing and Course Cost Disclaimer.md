# ECS Pricing and Course Cost Disclaimer

Before we move further into the course, it's important to talk briefly about **ECS pricing** and also the **expected costs for this course**. This will give you a clear understanding of any charges you might incur.

## üîπ ECS Launch Type Pricing

### 1. **EC2 Launch Type**
- You pay for the **underlying EC2 instances**, **volumes**, **load balancers**, **EFS**, etc.
- There's **no additional charge for ECS itself** ‚Äì it‚Äôs considered a *"free"* service to use.

### 2. **Fargate Launch Type**
- You only pay for the **vCPU and memory** requested for your application.
- No need to manage or provision EC2 instances.
- Example pricing in **US East (Ohio)** region:
  - **On-Demand:**
    - ~$0.04048 per vCPU per hour
    - ~$0.004445 per GB per hour
  - **Spot Pricing:**
    - ~**$0.010** per vCPU per hour
    - ~**$0.001** per GB per hour

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Note on Spot Pricing:**
Using spot pricing can save money, but it's risky. Amazon can **reclaim your resources at any time**, which means your containers may stop running unexpectedly.

## üí∞ Course Cost Expectations

- While you could technically use **AWS Free Tier**, it only includes **T2.micro instances**, which aren't powerful enough for this course.
- Therefore, it's **recommended to allocate at least $20** to cover the cost of services used throughout the course.

## ‚úÖ Cost-Saving Tips

- If you **pause the course**, be sure to **terminate all EC2 instances** to avoid unnecessary charges.
- Also, **scale down your ECS services to 0 tasks** to stop billing.
