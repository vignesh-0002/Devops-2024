# 🚀 ECS Cluster Setup: EC2 vs Fargate

## 📌 Overview

In this section, we will walk through creating ECS clusters using both **EC2** and **Fargate** launch types via the AWS Management Console. We will also learn the differences between them and perform cleanup afterward.

## 🛠️ Step 1: EC2-Based ECS Cluster Setup

### 🔧 Preparation

We already have:

- A custom VPC
- Two public subnets across different Availability Zones

These were provisioned using Infrastructure-as-Code tools (e.g., CloudFormation or Terraform).

### ✅ Create EC2 ECS Cluster

1. Go to the **ECS Console** in AWS.
2. Choose **Create Cluster**.
3. Select **EC2 Linux + Networking**.
4. Provide a name for your cluster, e.g., `x-course-ec2`.

### 🌐 Networking

1. In the **Networking** section:
   - Select the **custom VPC** you previously created.
   - Choose both **public subnets**.

### ⚙️ EC2 Instance Settings

- **Instance type**: Choose `t3.micro` or `a1.medium` to minimize cost.
- **Desired capacity**: 1 to 5 instances (based on expected load).
- Leave other defaults as-is.

### ✅ Create Cluster

Click **Create** and wait for the ECS cluster to be provisioned.

### 📊 View Cluster Details

- After creation, go to the cluster overview.
- Under **Infrastructure > Container Instances**, confirm that an EC2 instance has been provisioned.

## 🚀 Step 2: Fargate-Based ECS Cluster Setup

### 🔧 What’s Different?

- **Fargate** is serverless—no need to provision or manage EC2 instances.
- Tasks run directly in subnets without launching EC2 infrastructure.

### ✅ Create Fargate ECS Cluster

1. Navigate back to the ECS Console.
2. Choose **Create Cluster**.
3. Select **Fargate**.
4. Give the cluster a name, e.g., `x-course-fargate`.
5. Select the same **VPC** and **public subnets** used earlier.
6. Leave remaining settings as default.
7. Click **Create**.

### 📊 View Cluster Details

- After creation, go to the cluster overview.
- Under **Infrastructure > Container Instances**, confirm **no EC2 instances** exist.

## 🧹 Cleanup

To avoid unnecessary charges, delete the clusters:

### 🔥 Delete EC2 Cluster

1. Go to the EC2 cluster (`x-course-ec2`).
2. Click **Delete Cluster**.
3. Confirm deletion by typing the cluster name.
4. Wait until the instance and cluster are fully deleted.

### 🔥 Delete Fargate Cluster

1. Go to the Fargate cluster (`x-course-fargate`).
2. Click **Delete Cluster**.
3. Confirm deletion.
4. Refresh to verify that the cluster is removed.

## ✅ Summary

| Feature | EC2 Launch Type | Fargate Launch Type |
|--------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Instance Management | Required | Not required |
| Billing | Per EC2 hour | Per task duration |
| Setup Complexity | Higher | Lower |
| Best For | Full control | Simplicity, scalability |

**💡 Tip:** Use **Fargate** when you want serverless simplicity and automatic scaling.
