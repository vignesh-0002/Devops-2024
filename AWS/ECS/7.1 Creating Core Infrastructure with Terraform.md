# 🏗️ Creating Core Infrastructure with Terraform

## 📌 Overview

In this guide, we’ll use **Terraform**, a popular Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool, to create the core AWS infrastructure required to deploy applications. This allows us to automate provisioning, version-control our infrastructure, and avoid manual setup via the AWS Console.

---

## 🌐 Infrastructure Architecture

We are going to provision the following AWS resources:

- A **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**
- Two **Public Subnets** in different **Availability Zones**
- An **Internet Gateway (IGW)**
- A **Public Route Table** with a route to the IGW
- **Subnet associations** with the route table
- **Terraform outputs** to expose key resource IDs

---

## 🛠️ Manual vs Automated Setup

While you could create this infrastructure manually via the AWS Console, it’s inefficient and error-prone. With **Terraform**, you define your infrastructure declaratively in `.tf` files and deploy using the `terraform apply` command.

---

## 📄 Understanding the Terraform Configuration

We will break the setup into the following Terraform resources:

### ✅ `provider` Block
Specifies the AWS provider and region.

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}
```
## ✅ VPC

```hcl
resource "aws_vpc" "main" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
  tags = {
    Name = "core-vpc"
  }
}
```
## ✅ Subnets
```hcl

resource "aws_subnet" "public_1" {
  vpc_id            = aws_vpc.main.id
  cidr_block        = "10.0.1.0/24"
  availability_zone = "us-east-1a"
  tags = {
    Name = "public-subnet-1"
  }
}

resource "aws_subnet" "public_2" {
  vpc_id            = aws_vpc.main.id
  cidr_block        = "10.0.2.0/24"
  availability_zone = "us-east-1b"
  tags = {
    Name = "public-subnet-2"
  }
}
```
## ✅ Internet Gateway and Attachment
```hcl
resource "aws_internet_gateway" "igw" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.main.id
  tags = {
    Name = "core-igw"
  }
}
```

## ✅ Route Table and Associations

```hcl
resource "aws_route_table" "public" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.main.id
  tags = {
    Name = "public-route-table"
  }
}

resource "aws_route" "default_route" {
  route_table_id         = aws_route_table.public.id
  destination_cidr_block = "0.0.0.0/0"
  gateway_id             = aws_internet_gateway.igw.id
}

resource "aws_route_table_association" "public_1" {
  subnet_id      = aws_subnet.public_1.id
  route_table_id = aws_route_table.public.id
}

resource "aws_route_table_association" "public_2" {
  subnet_id      = aws_subnet.public_2.id
  route_table_id = aws_route_table.public.id
}
```
## 🧪 Deploying the Infrastructure with Terraform
### Step 1: Initialize Terraform
```
terraform init
```
### Step 2: Review the Plan
```
terraform plan
```
### Step 3: Apply the Configuration
```
terraform apply
``` 

✅ Confirm when prompted by typing yes.

## 📊 Monitoring Resource Creation
Once terraform apply completes:

* ✅ Resources are provisioned automatically in AWS

* 📤 Terraform displays output values (if defined)

* 🔎 Validate resources in the AWS Console under VPC, Subnets, Internet Gateways, and Route Tables


## 🔍 Validating Resource Creation in AWS Console
* 🔹 VPC
Navigate to VPC > Your VPCs and confirm your VPC is listed.

* 🔹 Subnets
Go to VPC > Subnets and verify both subnets exist in the correct Availability Zones and CIDR blocks.

* 🔹 Internet Gateway
Open Internet Gateways and check that the IGW is present and attached to your VPC.

* 🔹 Route Tables
Go to Route Tables and verify:

* A route to 0.0.0.0/0 exists pointing to the Internet Gateway

* Both public subnets are associated with this route table

## 📤 Terraform Outputs
Define outputs in outputs.tf like this:

```
output "vpc_id" {
  description = "The ID of the VPC"
  value       = aws_vpc.main.id
}

output "public_subnet_1_id" {
  description = "The ID of public subnet 1"
  value       = aws_subnet.public_1.id
}

output "public_subnet_2_id" {
  description = "The ID of public subnet 2"
  value       = aws_subnet.public_2.id
}
```
These outputs are useful for:

* 🧰 CLI automation

* 🔗 Referencing in another Terraform module

* 🐛 Debugging or gaining visibility during setup

## ✅ Summary
With this Terraform setup, you now have:

* 📦 A production-grade, version-controlled network infrastructure

* 🌐 VPC, public subnets, Internet Gateway, route tables, and subnet associations

* ♻️ Reusable outputs for future modules or integrations

## 🎯 Recommendation
Always use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform to manage your AWS environments. It provides speed, repeatability, and avoids manual configuration errors.
