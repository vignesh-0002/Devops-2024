# 🏗️ Creating Core Infrastructure with AWS CloudFormation

## 📌 Overview

In this guide, we’ll create the core infrastructure required to deploy applications on AWS. Instead of setting up everything manually through the AWS Console, we'll use **AWS CloudFormation** to automate the provisioning process with a single YAML template.

---

## 🌐 Infrastructure Architecture

We are going to set up the following:

- A **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**
- Two **Public Subnets** in different **Availability Zones**
- An **Internet Gateway** (IGW)
- A **Public Route Table** with a default route to the IGW
- Subnet associations with the route table
- CloudFormation **Outputs** to expose created resources

---

## 🛠️ Manual vs. Automated Setup

While AWS Console allows you to create these resources manually by clicking through the UI, it’s error-prone and not scalable. With **CloudFormation**, you define everything in a YAML file and deploy it with one command using the **AWS CLI**.

---

## 📄 Understanding the CloudFormation Template

The CloudFormation YAML file includes:

### ✅ Mappings

Used to define Availability Zones and subnet configurations such as CIDR blocks.

### ✅ Resources

Includes definitions for:

- `AWS::EC2::VPC`: The main VPC block
- `AWS::EC2::Subnet`: For public subnets across AZs
- `AWS::EC2::InternetGateway`: Internet Gateway for external access
- `AWS::EC2::VPCGatewayAttachment`: To attach IGW to the VPC
- `AWS::EC2::RouteTable`: Public Route Table
- `AWS::EC2::Route`: Default route to IGW
- `AWS::EC2::SubnetRouteTableAssociation`: Associate subnets with route table

### ✅ Outputs

CloudFormation Outputs allow referencing critical information after the stack is deployed, such as:

- VPC ID
- Public Subnet IDs
- Internet Gateway ID

---

## 🧪 Deploying the Stack with AWS CLI

After saving your YAML file (e.g., `core-infrastructure-setup.yaml`), deploy it using the following CLI command:

```bash
aws cloudformation create-stack \
  --stack-name core-infrastructure \
  --template-body file://core-infrastructure-setup.yaml \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM
```

## 📊 Monitoring the Stack Creation

Go to the **AWS Console > CloudFormation**:

- You’ll see a stack named `core-infrastructure` with status: `CREATE_IN_PROGRESS`
- Once completed, the status changes to `CREATE_COMPLETE`
- Click on the stack name to explore the following tabs:

### 🔸 Events
A step-by-step log of each resource being created by the template.

### 🔸 Resources
A complete list of resources provisioned as part of the stack.

### 🔸 Outputs
Key values like VPC ID, Subnet IDs, and IGW ID that are useful for referencing in other stacks or deployments.

---

## 🔍 Validating Resource Creation

After the stack has been successfully created, validate the following resources in the AWS Console:

### 🔹 VPC
Go to **VPC > Your VPCs** and verify that your VPC is listed.

### 🔹 Subnets
Navigate to **VPC > Subnets** and ensure both public subnets exist with the correct CIDR blocks and assigned AZs.

### 🔹 Internet Gateway
Go to **Internet Gateways**, check that the IGW is present and **attached to your VPC**.

### 🔹 Route Tables
Go to **Route Tables** and verify:

- A route to `0.0.0.0/0` that points to the Internet Gateway exists
- Both public subnets are associated with this route table

---

## 📤 Outputs Example

Here’s a sample `Outputs` section from your CloudFormation template:

```yaml
Outputs:
  VPCId:
    Description: VPC ID
    Value: !Ref MyVPC

  PublicSubnet1Id:
    Description: ID of Public Subnet 1
    Value: !Ref PublicSubnet1

  PublicSubnet2Id:
    Description: ID of Public Subnet 2
    Value: !Ref PublicSubnet2
```

These outputs will be visible under the **Outputs** tab in the CloudFormation Console after stack creation. They can be used for:

- 🧰 **CLI automation**
- 🔗 **Referencing in another CloudFormation stack**
- 🐛 **Debugging or visibility during setup**

---

## ✅ Summary

With this CloudFormation template, you now have:

- 📦 A reliable, version-controlled infrastructure setup  
- 🌐 VPC, subnets, route tables, and Internet Gateway all provisioned  
- ♻️ Reusable outputs for future deployments  

> 🎯 **Recommendation:** Always use **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** tools like **CloudFormation** or **Terraform** to manage your AWS environments. It's faster, more secure, and helps eliminate manual configuration errors.
