# Networking Fundamentals for AWS Lambda

## Default Networking Behavior

By default, when you launch your Lambda functions, they're launched **outside of your own VPC**â€”specifically, within an AWS-managed VPC. 

- You **do not have access to resources within your own VPC**.
- If you launch an RDS database, ElastiCache, or an internal load balancer in your VPC, your Lambda function will **not** be able to access them.
- This default deployment **does work** for:
  - Accessing public APIs on the internet
  - Accessing AWS public services like **DynamoDB**

However, if you have a **private RDS database**, connectivity will **not** work with the default setup.

## Connecting Lambda to a VPC

To enable Lambda to connect to private resources like RDS, you need to **launch your Lambda function inside your VPC**.

Steps:
1. Specify your **VPC ID**
2. Provide the **subnets** to launch into
3. Attach a **security group** to the Lambda function

When done, your Lambda function will be associated with **Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs)** in your subnets. This enables access to:
- RDS
- ElastiCache
- Internal load balancers

### Result:
Private connectivity to resources in your VPC.

## Use Case: Lambda with RDS Proxy

Lambda functions can connect to an RDS database, but direct connections are problematic due to:

- Large number of Lambda invocations
- Many short-lived database connections
- Potential **timeouts** and **overload** on RDS

### Solution: Use **RDS Proxy**

With RDS Proxy:

- The proxy **pools and shares connections**
- **Reduces** the number of open connections to RDS
- Lambda functions connect to **RDS Proxy**, which connects to the actual RDS instance

#### Benefits of RDS Proxy:

1. **Scalability**: Connection pooling improves performance.
2. **Availability**: Reduces failover time by **66%**, preserving connections.
3. **IAM Authentication**: Enforce authentication at the proxy level using **Secrets Manager**.

> Note: For this setup to work, Lambda **must be launched in your VPC** because the RDS Proxy is never public.

## Summary

- Lambda functions launched **outside your VPC** can't access private AWS resources.
- To connect to resources like RDS, launch your Lambda in your **VPC with correct subnets and security groups**.
- Use **RDS Proxy** for better scalability, failover handling, and secure IAM access.
