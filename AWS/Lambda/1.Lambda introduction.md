# 🚀 Understanding AWS Lambda

## 🧠 What is AWS Lambda?

AWS Lambda is a **serverless compute service** that lets you run code **without provisioning or managing servers**. You simply upload your code, and Lambda runs it **on demand**, automatically handling the scaling and infrastructure.

---

## 🆚 Example Comparison: EC2 vs. Lambda

### 🖥️ Amazon EC2:
- You provision virtual servers (instances).
- You’re responsible for:
  - Choosing CPU and memory.
  - Starting/stopping/managing them.
  - Keeping them running even when idle.
- Auto Scaling is available but requires setup.

### ⚡ AWS Lambda:
- No servers to manage.
- You upload code (functions) that:
  - Run **on demand**.
  - Are limited to **15 minutes** per execution.
  - **Only run when triggered**, saving cost.
- **Scaling is automatic** — Lambda handles concurrency for you.

## 💡 Benefits of AWS Lambda

- **Cost-efficient**: Pay only for compute time and requests.
- **Scalable**: Auto-scales based on load.
- **Event-driven**: Runs only when triggered.
- **Language Support**:
  - Built-in: Node.js, Python, Java, C#, PowerShell, Ruby.
  - Custom: Go, Rust, etc., via [Custom Runtime API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-custom.html).
- **Container support**: You can run Docker containers by implementing the Lambda Runtime API.
- **RAM up to 10 GB**: More RAM = better CPU/network performance.
- **Monitoring built-in**: Integrates with Amazon CloudWatch.

## 🔁 Lambda Integrations (Trigger Sources)

| **Service**        | **Use Case**                                              |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **API Gateway**     | Trigger Lambda from HTTP/REST API requests.              |
| **Kinesis**         | Real-time stream processing and data transformation.     |
| **DynamoDB**        | Triggers on table changes for real-time DB reactions.    |
| **S3**              | Run a function when a file is uploaded.                  |
| **CloudFront**      | Lambda@Edge for CDN-level custom behavior.               |
| **EventBridge / CloudWatch Events** | Schedule CRON jobs or respond to AWS events.   |
| **SNS / SQS**       | Process messages or notifications.                       |
| **Cognito**         | Run logic when a user signs in or updates profile.       |

## 🖼️ Example Use Cases

### 1. 🎨 **Serverless Thumbnail Creation**

- **Trigger**: Image uploaded to S3.
- **Action**: Lambda function creates a thumbnail.
- **Result**: Thumbnail saved in S3 + metadata in DynamoDB.

### 2. ⏰ **Serverless CRON Job**

- **Trigger**: CloudWatch Event every 1 hour.
- **Action**: Lambda function runs a background task.
- **Benefit**: No EC2 instance running 24/7 for scheduled jobs.

## 💰 Lambda Pricing

### 1. **Requests**
- First **1 million requests/month** = Free.
- After = **$0.20 per 1 million requests**.

### 2. **Compute Time (GB-seconds)**
- First **400,000 GB-seconds/month** = Free.
- After = **$1 per 600,000 GB-seconds**.

💡 *GB-second = 1 second of runtime with 1 GB of memory allocated.*
- More RAM → more cost, but better performance.

## 🔚 Summary

AWS Lambda is ideal for:
- Running short, stateless, event-driven code.
- Cutting down infrastructure costs.
- Building scalable microservices.
- Creating automation and integrations across AWS services.
