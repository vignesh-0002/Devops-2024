# AWS Lambda Limits (For Exam Preparation)

It's important to know the AWS Lambda **limits** before taking the exam, as these are common exam topics. These limits are **per region** and fall into two categories: **execution limits** and **deployment limits**.

## üß† Execution Limits

| Resource                | Limit                                  |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Memory allocation       | 128 MB ‚Äì 10,240 MB (10 GB) in 64 MB increments |
| vCPU                    | Increases proportionally with memory     |
| Maximum execution time  | 900 seconds (15 minutes)                |
| Environment variables   | Up to 4 KB total                        |
| `/tmp` directory size   | Up to 10 GB temporary storage           |
| Concurrent executions   | 1,000 by default (can request increase) |

- **Note**: Use **reserved concurrency** to manage execution limits effectively.

## üì¶ Deployment Limits

| Deployment Type             | Limit            |
|-----------------------------|------------------|
| Max compressed package size | 50 MB (ZIP)      |
| Max uncompressed size       | 250 MB           |

- For files **larger than 250 MB**, use the `/tmp` directory during execution.
- Environment variable limit: **4 KB**

---

## üí° Important Exam Scenarios

When presented with scenarios in the exam, use these limits to determine whether Lambda is appropriate:

- ‚ùå **30 GB RAM needed** ‚Üí Not supported (max is 10 GB)
- ‚ùå **30 minutes execution time** ‚Üí Not supported (max is 15 minutes)
- ‚ùå **3 GB file to handle** ‚Üí Must use `/tmp` or a different service

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

Know these limits by heart‚Äîthey help you answer scenario-based questions effectively:

- Memory, duration, environment size, deployment package size
- When to use `/tmp` for larger files
- Understand concurrency and how to scale with requests
