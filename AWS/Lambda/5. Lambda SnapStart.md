# Lambda SnapStart

Lambda SnapStart is a **performance optimization feature** that can improve the **startup time** of your AWS Lambda functions by **up to 10x** — **at no extra cost**. It currently supports functions written in **Java**, **Python**, and **.NET**.

---

## 🧠 Purpose

The main goal of SnapStart is to help your Lambda functions start **much faster**, improving responsiveness and reducing latency, especially for cold starts.

---

## 🛠️ What Happens When SnapStart Is Disabled?

When SnapStart is **not enabled**, a Lambda function goes through the following **three life cycle phases** every time it is invoked:

1. **Initialize** – The function's runtime and dependencies are initialized.
2. **Invoke** – The function executes the handler logic.
3. **Shutdown** – Resources are cleaned up.

The **initialization phase** can be **time-consuming**, especially for Java functions, which may require loading complex environments and libraries.

## ⚡ How SnapStart Works

When SnapStart is **enabled**, AWS applies an optimization technique during function deployment:

1. When you **publish a new version** of your Lambda function:
    - AWS **initializes** the function **once**.
    - AWS takes a **snapshot** of the memory and disk state.
2. This **snapshot** is then **cached** and reused to **bypass the initialization phase** during each future invocation.

As a result, the function **skips initialization** and jumps directly to the **invoke phase**, leading to significantly **lower latency**.

---

## ✅ Summary

- **Lambda SnapStart** speeds up cold starts by **reusing pre-initialized snapshots**.
- Supported for: **Java**, **Python**, and **.NET**.
- Enabled **at the time of publishing a new version** of the function.
- Offers **up to 10x faster performance** with **no additional cost**.
