# Customization at the Edge

## Introduction

Customization at the Edge allows executing logic close to users before traffic reaches your backend applications. This is commonly done using **Edge Functions**, attached to **CloudFront distributions**.

These functions help minimize latency and enhance the user experience.

### Two Types of Edge Functions in CloudFront:

- **CloudFront Functions**
- **Lambda@Edge**

## Key Benefits

- Serverless (no infrastructure to manage)
- Globally deployed
- Pay only for what you use
- Use cases include:
  - Website security and privacy
  - Dynamic web applications
  - SEO optimization
  - Intelligent origin routing
  - Bot mitigation
  - Real-time image transformation
  - A/B testing
  - User authentication and authorization
  - User tracking and analytics

## CloudFront Functions

### Overview

- Lightweight JavaScript functions
- High-scale, low-latency (sub-millisecond startup)
- Handle **viewer request** and **viewer response** only
- Managed natively within CloudFront

### Request Flow with CloudFront

1. **Viewer Request**: Client sends request to CloudFront
2. **Origin Request**: CloudFront sends request to origin
3. **Origin Response**: Origin sends response back to CloudFront
4. **Viewer Response**: CloudFront sends response to client

### CloudFront Functions can modify:

- **Viewer Request**: Before CloudFront forwards to origin
- **Viewer Response**: Before CloudFront sends to viewer

## Lambda@Edge

### Overview

- Functions written in **Node.js** or **Python**
- Handles **all four** request/response stages:
  - Viewer Request
  - Origin Request
  - Origin Response
  - Viewer Response
- Deployed from **us-east-1**, then replicated globally

### Capabilities

- Scales to **thousands of requests per second**
- Up to **5â€“10 seconds** execution time
- Supports **adjustable CPU/memory**
- Can use **third-party libraries**
- **Network access** and **file system access**
- Can access **request body**

## Use Cases

### CloudFront Functions

- **Cache Key Normalization**
- **Header Manipulation**
- **URL Rewrites and Redirects**
- **Authorization** (e.g., JWT token validation)

> All executed in **< 1 millisecond**

### Lambda@Edge

- Complex logic requiring:
  - Longer execution
  - SDK usage
  - Access to body
