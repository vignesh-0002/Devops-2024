# Integration Between RDS, Aurora, and Lambda

There is a **tight integration** between AWS services such as **RDS**, **Aurora**, and **Lambda** — but with important distinctions and setup steps to keep in mind.

## Invoking Lambda from Within the Database

You can **invoke Lambda functions directly from within your database instance** in specific cases. This allows you to process **data events** occurring within your database in near real time.

### Supported Databases
- **RDS for PostgreSQL**
- **Aurora MySQL**

### Example Use Case

1. A user inserts an event into a registration table.
2. The database is configured to invoke a Lambda function.
3. The Lambda function sends a welcome email to the user.

> ⚠️ **This configuration is done from within the database itself**, not via the AWS Console.

### Key Requirements

- The **RDS instance initiates the invocation** of the Lambda function.
- Ensure **network connectivity**:
  - The Lambda function must be accessible from the RDS instance.
  - Options: **public internet**, **NAT Gateway**, or **VPC endpoints**.
- IAM permissions:
  - The RDS database instance must have the correct **IAM policy** to invoke the Lambda function.

## RDS Event Notifications (Not the Same)

This is **completely different** from invoking Lambda functions based on **data changes**.

### What RDS Event Notifications Do

These are **infrastructure-level notifications**, such as:

- Database instance events (created, started, stopped)
- Snapshots
- Parameter groups
- Security groups
- Proxies
- Custom engine versions

### Delivery Options

- Near real-time (up to 5-minute delay)
- Send to:
  - **SNS** (and from there to Lambda or SQS)
  - **EventBridge** (many destinations, including Lambda)

> ❗ **Important Note:**  
> These notifications **do not provide any information about the data** within your database.

---

## Summary

- **To act on data-level events**, you must invoke Lambda from within the database instance.
- **RDS event notifications** are for database instance metadata only.
- Proper **network configuration** and **IAM permissions** are essential for Lambda invocation from RDS/Aurora.

I hope this helps clarify the integration possibilities. Let me know if you'd like an architecture diagram for this setup!
