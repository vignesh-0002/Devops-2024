# Steps to Use Terraform with GCP
`1. Create a Service Account in GCP`

- Go to the GCP Console > IAM & Admin > Service Accounts.

- Click “Create Service Account”.

- Give it a name like terraform-admin.

- Click “Create and Continue”.

`2. Assign Required Roles`
- For VPC creation, you typically need at least:

- Compute Network Admin

- Compute Admin

- (Optionally: Project Viewer, Service Account User)

 - For full Terraform control, you can also use Editor temporarily — but it's better to scope roles by least privilege.

`3. Create and Download a JSON Key`
- After assigning roles, click “Done”.

- In the service account list, click your new service account.

- Go to the “Keys” tab.

- Click “Add Key > Create New Key”

- Choose JSON, then click Create.

- Save the .json key file securely — this is your credentials file.

`4. Configure Terraform to Use the Key`
- In your terminal, set the following environment variable:

```
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/your/service-account-key.json"
```

Or, specify it directly in Terraform using a provider block:

```
provider "google" {
  credentials = file("path/to/your/service-account-key.json")
  project     = "your-gcp-project-id"
  region      = "your-region"
}
```

`5. Run Terraform as Usual`

```
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```
