# What is a VPC?

Google Cloud Platform's (GCP) Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a globally distributed, scalable, and flexible networking service that provides a virtualized network environment for your cloud resources. It enables you to define and manage network configurations, including IP address ranges, subnets, routes, and firewall rules, to securely connect and isolate your cloud-based workloads.

# Core Components of GCP VPC:

`VPC Networks:` 
- A VPC network is a global resource that spans all available regions. It serves as a container for subnets and defines the network topology for your resources. 
- Unlike traditional networks, GCP VPCs do not have a global IP range; instead, IP ranges are assigned at the subnet level.

`Subnets:`
- Subnets are regional resources within a VPC network. 
- Each subnet is associated with a specific region and has its own IP address range.
- You can create multiple subnets in different regions under the same VPC network, facilitating global resource distribution.

`Firewall Rules:`
- GCP VPC includes a distributed, stateful firewall that allows you to control traffic to and from your instances.
- Firewall rules are defined at the network level and can be applied based on instance tags, service accounts, or IP ranges.

`Routes:` 
- Routes determine how traffic flows within your VPC network and to external destinations. 
- GCP automatically creates system-generated routes for each subnet, and you can define custom static routes as needed.

`Cloud NAT:`
- Cloud NAT (Network Address Translation) enables instances without external IP addresses to access the internet securely. 
- It provides outbound internet access while keeping your instances private.
