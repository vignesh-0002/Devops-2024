# Configuring Jenkins Master And Slave Using AWS EC2 Instance

Here we are using Amazon Web Services to achieve Jenkins master's and slave.

## Step 1: Create EC2 Instances
Create two EC2 instances and name them as **Jenkins Server** and **Jenkins Node**.

## Step 2: Install Jenkins and Java
- In one of the nodes, install **Jenkins**, which will act as the **master node**.
- Install **Java** in the second server, which will act as the **slave (worker) node**.
- Establish SSH access to the worker node and create a directory called `node1`.

### Creating a directory
```bash
mkdir node1
```

## Step 3: Manage Nodes in Jenkins
- Open **Jenkins** and click on **Manage Jenkins**.
- Find the option called **Nodes** and click on it.

### Manage Nodes

## Step 4: Add a New Node
- On the left side, click on **New Node**.
- Configure all details for the **slave (worker) node**.
- In the **Node Name** section, give the desired name of the node.

## Step 5: Configure Node Details
- **No of executors**: One (as we are using only one slave).
- **Remote root directory**: Path of the directory created in Step 2 (`node1`).

- **Label**: Assign a label (e.g., `node`) to be used in the project configuration.

- **Usage**: Select **As much as possible**.

### Configuration Details of Node

## Step 6: Configure SSH Launch Method
- Select **Launch agents via SSH**.
- In the **Host** section, enter the **IP address** of the slave (worker node).
- Configure **SSH credentials**.  (I have added the steps to configure Jenkins credentials in the end of this docs)
- In the **Host Key Verification Strategy** section, select **Manually trusted key strategy**.

### Launching SSH Agent

- In the **Node Properties** section, leave everything unselected.

## Step 7: Verify Slave Node Status
- The **slave node** should now be online and ready to use in projects.

### Slave Running
- The **built-in node** is the **master**, and the second node is the **slave**.

## Integration of Slave Node to Jenkins Project

Follow these steps to integrate the Jenkins project with the slave:

### Step 1: Configure Project Settings
- Click on **General**.
- Click on **Restrict where this project should run**.
- In the **Label Expression** dropdown, select the label assigned during **slave node configuration**.

### Node Configuration

Now you can build projects in the **worker node** successfully.


## jenkins Credential configuration

### *Step 1: Open Jenkins Dashboard*
- Login to Jenkins.
- Click on Manage Jenkins from the left sidebar.
- Click on Manage Credentials.

### *Step 2: Select Credential Store*
- Under Stores scoped to Jenkins, select (global) if you want to store credentials globally.
- Alternatively, select a specific folder or project if you want the credentials to be project-specific.

### *Step 3: Add New Credentials*
- Click on Add Credentials on the left.
- In the Kind dropdown, select SSH Username with Private Key.

### *Step 4: Configure SSH Key Details*
- Username: Enter the SSH username (e.g., ubuntu).
- We are providing user name as ununtu because we are configuring the slave node as ubuntu ec2 so the ssh user is ubuntu.

- Private Key: Choose one of the following options:
- Enter directly: Copy and paste your private SSH key (id_rsa content).

- From a file on Jenkins master: If the key is stored on the Jenkins server, provide the file path.
- Use SSH Key stored in Jenkins: If a key is already stored, select this option.
- (Optional) Passphrase: Enter the passphrase if your SSH key has one.
