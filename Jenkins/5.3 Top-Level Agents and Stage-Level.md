Differences Between Top-Level Agents and Stage-Level Agents in Jenkins Declarative Pipeline
In Jenkins, agents determine where the pipeline or specific stages execute. The placement of the agent declaration (either top-level or stage-level) affects the behavior of certain directives, such as timeout.

ðŸ”¹ Top-Level Agents
Definition: When an agent is declared at the top-level inside the pipeline {} block.
Behavior:
The agent is allocated first.
The timeout starts counting only after the agent is allocated.
The time taken to allocate the agent is not included in the timeout.
âœ… Example: Top-Level Agent with Timeout
groovy
Copy
Edit
pipeline {
    agent any
    options {
        // Timeout counter starts AFTER agent is allocated
        timeout(time: 1, unit: 'SECONDS')
    }
    stages {
        stage('Example') {
            steps {
                echo 'Hello World'
            }
        }
    }
}
ðŸ”¹ Explanation:

The pipeline will run on any available agent.
The timeout(time: 1, unit: 'SECONDS') applies after the agent is allocated.
If the agent allocation takes 5 seconds, the timeout starts after those 5 seconds.
ðŸ”¹ Stage-Level Agents
Definition: When an agent is declared inside a specific stage.
Behavior:
Options (like timeout) apply before allocating the agent.
The timeout includes agent provisioning time.
If agent allocation takes too long, the pipeline might fail due to timeout.
âœ… Example: Stage-Level Agent with Timeout
groovy
Copy
Edit
pipeline {
    agent none  // No global agent
    stages {
        stage('Example') {
            agent any
            options {
                // Timeout counter starts BEFORE agent is allocated
                timeout(time: 1, unit: 'SECONDS')
            }
            steps {
                echo 'Hello World'
            }
        }
    }
}
ðŸ”¹ Explanation:

The pipeline does not have a global agent (agent none).
The Example stage runs on any available agent.
The timeout starts before the agent is allocated.
If agent allocation takes more than 1 second, the pipeline fails.
ðŸ”¹ Key Differences: Top-Level vs. Stage-Level Agents
Feature	Top-Level Agent	Stage-Level Agent
Scope	Applies to the entire pipeline	Applies only to a specific stage
Timeout Behavior	Starts after agent allocation	Starts before agent allocation
Agent Provisioning Time	Not included in timeout	Included in timeout
Best Use Case	When all stages run on the same agent	When different stages require different agents
