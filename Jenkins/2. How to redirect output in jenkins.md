# Redirecting Job Output in Jenkins

In Jenkins, you can redirect the output of a job.

## 1. **Redirecting Console Output to a File**

If you want to redirect the console output of a Jenkins job to a file, you can modify the shell or batch command executed in your build step. Here's how:

### **Steps for Redirecting Console Output in Build Steps:**

### **Open Job Configuration:**
- Go to your Jenkins job.
- Click **"Configure"** on the left menu to edit your job.

### **Modify Build Step (e.g., Shell or Batch):**
- Under the **Build** section, add a build step like **"Execute Shell"** (for Linux/macOS) or **"Execute Windows batch command"** (for Windows).

### **Add Redirection Command:**
- For **Linux/macOS**, use the `>` or `>>` operator to redirect output to a file.

  **Example (in a Shell build step):**
           
                    NAME=Vignesh
                    echo "Hello, $NAME,  Current date and time is $(date)" > /tmp/info

- The `>`operator overwrites the file, and `>>` appends to the file.

     **Example:**
  
                     NAME=Vignesh
                     echo "Hello, $NAME,  Current date and time is $(date)" > /tmp/info

- So the output is stored on '/tmp/info/' directory on my jenkins host.
