# Step-by-Step Guide to Create a Simple Jenkins Job

### 1. **Access Jenkins Dashboard**
   - Open Jenkins in your browser. Typically, the URL is `http://localhost:8080` or the server’s IP/hostname.
   - Log in with your credentials.

### 2. **Create a New Job**
   - On the Jenkins dashboard, click **"New Item"** from the left-hand side menu.
   - You will be prompted to enter a name for your new job. Choose a descriptive name (e.g., `SimpleBuildJob`).
   - Select the job type. For a simple job, choose **"Freestyle project"** (this is the most basic type).
   - Click **"OK"** to proceed.

### 3. **Configure Job**
   You are now on the configuration page for your job. Follow these steps to configure it:

   #### **General Section:**
   - **Description (Optional)**: You can add a description for your job (e.g., "This is a simple build job for learning Jenkins").

   #### **Source Code Management:**
   - If you’re using a version control system (VCS) like Git, select **"Git"** under **Source Code Management**.
     - **Repository URL**: Enter the URL of your Git repository.
     - **Credentials**: If needed, enter your repository credentials.
   - For a simple job that doesn't require source code management, leave this section as is.

   #### **Build Triggers:**
   - **Build Periodically**: You can set a schedule (like `H/5 * * * *` for triggering the job every 5 minutes) using cron syntax.
   - **Poll SCM**: Jenkins can poll your repository for changes and trigger the job when it detects new commits (e.g., every 5 minutes).
   - **Build After Other Projects are Built**: Trigger this job after other jobs have been completed.
   - For a basic setup, you can leave this empty or configure based on your needs.

   #### **Build Section:**
   - Under **Build**, click **"Add build step"** and choose the relevant action for your job. Common steps include:
     - **Execute Shell** (Linux/macOS) or **Execute Windows batch command** (Windows).
     - For example, you can use:
       - **Shell**: `echo "Hello, Jenkins!"`
       - **Batch Command (Windows)**: `echo Hello, Jenkins!`

       - This command will run every time the job is executed.
     

   #### **Post-build Actions (Optional):**
   - You can add post-build actions like:
     - **Archive the build artifacts**: Store files produced by the build process.
     - **Send Email Notifications**: Notify the team about the build status.
     - **Build other projects**: Trigger other Jenkins jobs once this job completes.
   - For a simple job, you can skip this section or leave it empty.

### 4. **Save the Job**
   - After configuring the job, scroll down and click **"Save"**.

### 5. **Build the Job**
   - Once the job is created, you’ll be redirected to the job’s configuration page.
   - On the job’s page, click **"Build Now"** to manually trigger the build.
   - Jenkins will start executing the build process. You can view the console output by clicking on the build number in the **Build History** section.
