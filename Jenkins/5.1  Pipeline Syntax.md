# Pipeline Syntax

## Introduction
This section builds on the information introduced in "Getting Started with Pipeline" and should be treated solely as a reference. For more information on how to use Pipeline syntax in practical examples, refer to the "Using a Jenkinsfile" section of this chapter.

As of version 2.5 of the Pipeline plugin, Pipeline supports two discrete syntaxes:
- **Declarative Pipeline**
- **Scripted Pipeline**

For the pros and cons of each, refer to the **Syntax Comparison** section.

The most fundamental part of a Pipeline is the **step**. Steps tell Jenkins what to do and serve as the basic building blocks for both Declarative and Scripted Pipeline syntax.

For an overview of available steps, refer to the **Pipeline Steps Reference**: https://www.jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/steps/  , which contains a comprehensive list of steps built into Pipeline as well as steps provided by plugins.

## Declarative Pipeline
Declarative Pipeline presents a more simplified and opinionated syntax on top of the Pipeline sub-systems. To use them, install the **Pipeline: Declarative Plugin**.

All valid Declarative Pipelines must be enclosed within a `pipeline` block:

```groovy
pipeline {
    /* insert Declarative Pipeline here */
}
```

# 1️⃣ The top-level of the Pipeline must be a block, specifically: `pipeline {}`
This means that every Declarative Pipeline must start with a `pipeline {}` block.

✅ **Correct Example:**

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building the project...'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

❌ **Incorrect Example:**

```groovy
agent any  // ❌ ERROR! "agent" must be inside "pipeline {}"
stages {
    stage('Build') {
        steps {
            echo 'Building the project...'
        }
    }
}
```

👉 The `pipeline {}` block must always be present at the top.

---

# 2️⃣ No semicolons (`;`) as statement separators
In Groovy, you can use semicolons to separate statements, but in Declarative Pipeline, each statement must be on its own line.

✅ **Correct Example (no semicolons):**

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building the project'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

❌ **Incorrect Example (using semicolons):**

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any;
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building the project';  // ❌ ERROR! No semicolons allowed.
            };
        };
    };
}
```

👉 **Always** write each statement on a **separate line** without semicolons.

# 3️⃣ Blocks must only contain Sections, Directives, Steps, or Assignment Statements
Blocks (like `pipeline {}`, `stages {}`, `stage {}`) **must only** include valid Jenkins pipeline components like:
- **Sections** (e.g., `stages`, `post`)
- **Directives** (e.g., `agent`, `environment`)
- **Steps** (e.g., `echo`, `sh`)
- **Variable assignments** (e.g., `def x = 'Hello'`)

✅ **Correct Example:**

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    environment {
        BUILD_ENV = 'PRODUCTION'  // ✅ Variable assignment is allowed
    }
    stages {
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo "Environment: ${BUILD_ENV}"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

❌ **Incorrect Example (Invalid Statement inside block):**

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    "Hello World"  // ❌ ERROR! Only valid sections, directives, or assignments are allowed.
    
    stages {
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo 'Running tests...'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

👉 **Do not** put random expressions inside pipeline blocks.

# 4️⃣ Property reference is treated as a no-argument method invocation
In Groovy, you can call a method without parentheses. In Declarative Pipeline, **property references** are automatically treated as method calls with no arguments.

✅ **Correct Example:**

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Approval') {
            steps {
                input message: 'Deploy to Production?'  // ✅ "input" is treated as input()
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Here, `input` is treated as `input()`, even though we did not explicitly use parentheses.

❌ **Incorrect Example:**

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Approval') {
            steps {
                input()  // ❌ ERROR! Though this works, writing just "input" is preferred.
            }
        }
    }
}
```

👉 **You don't need parentheses** when calling methods like `input`, `timeout`, etc.

# 5️⃣ Use the Declarative Directive Generator
Jenkins provides a **Declarative Directive Generator**, which helps you easily generate pipeline syntax without memorizing everything.

✅ **How to Use It:**

1. Open **Jenkins Dashboard**.
2. Go to **"Pipeline Syntax"**.
3. Select **"Declarative Directive Generator"**.
4. Pick the directives you need (like `agent`, `environment`, `tools`).
5. Jenkins will generate the correct syntax for you.

This tool helps beginners create **error-free Declarative Pipelines** without worrying about syntax.

# 🚀 Final Simple Example:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any  // Runs on any available agent

    environment {
        MY_VAR = 'Hello, Jenkins!'
    }

    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo "Building project..."
                echo "Environment Variable: ${MY_VAR}"
            }
        }

        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                input message: 'Run tests now?'
                echo 'Running tests...'
            }
        }
    }

    post {
        success {
            echo 'Pipeline completed successfully! 🎉'
        }
        failure {
            echo 'Pipeline failed! ❌'
        }
    }
}
```

# 🔑 Key Takeaways
- ✅  Always use `pipeline {}` as the top-level block.
- ✅  Do **not** use semicolons (`;`).
- ✅  Blocks should only contain **sections, directives, steps, or assignments**.
- ✅  Property references (like `input`) behave like no-argument method calls (`input()`).
- ✅ Use **Jenkins Declarative Directive Generator** to easily create pipeline syntax.
