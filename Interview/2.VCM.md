# What is VCM?

- Here are the main uses of VCS beyond just saving history:

## Collaboration

- Multiple developers can work on the same project simultaneously.

- VCS manages merging of changes, resolving conflicts, and integrating contributions.

## Branching & Experimentation

- Developers can create branches to test features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase.

- Once tested, branches can be merged back.

## Tracking & Accountability

- Each commit records who made the change, when, and why (with commit messages).

- Helps with auditing and accountability in teams.

## Backup & Recovery

- Code is safely stored in remote repositories (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).

- If your local machine crashes, you can pull from the remote repository.

## Release Management

- Tags and releases help in managing different versions of software (e.g., v1.0, v2.1).

 ## Code Review & Collaboration Tools (with platforms like GitHub/GitLab)

- Pull requests / merge requests enable peer review before merging changes.

- Encourages code quality and knowledge sharing.

## Continuous Integration & Deployment (CI/CD)

- VCS integrates with automation tools to test, build, and deploy software whenever changes are pushed.
