# Tell me about yourself? 
Hello, my name is Vignesh. I began my career as a student intern consultant at Alpha Veer Technology. Later, I had the opportunity to work with one of their customers, nClouds, as a Junior DevOps Engineer. 
Over time, Alpha Veer was acquired by nClouds, and I transitioned into a new role as a Mid-level DevOps Engineer within the same organization.


# Explain your day-to-day tasks as a mid-level DevOps engineer.

### Key responsibility

In my current role as a mid-level DevOps engineer, Iâ€™m primarily responsible for building and maintaining the cloud infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code, primarily on AWS. 
A typical day involves a mix of Pipeline development, automation, monitoring, and collaboration.

### 1. Infrastructure Provisioning & Management:

- I use Terraform to define and manage infrastructure in a repeatable, version-controlled way.

- I work extensively with AWS services like EC2, S3, IAM, RDS, Lambda, and Ec2 to build scalable and secure environments.

- Monitored Amazon EKS clusters using CloudWatch, Datadog, and Prometheus to ensure health, performance, and availability of containerized microservices; proactively identified issues such as pod failures, resource bottlenecks etc..

 
### 2.  CI/CD Pipeline Development:

- One of my key responsibilities is maintaining and optimizing CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployments.

- We use tools like Jenkins to pull code from a shared codebase, run unit, integration and ensure regressions are caught early.

- I work closely with dev teams to align pipeline stages with their workflows and make sure deployments are smooth and repeatable.
