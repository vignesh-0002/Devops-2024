## In my day-to-day role as a DevOps Engineer
- I focus on three main areas: incident management, security/compliance, and cost optimization, along with infrastructure automation.

### Incident & Operational Management:
- I monitor and respond to incidents through tools like PagerDuty, prioritizing P1 issues. This involves troubleshooting, root cause analysis, and ensuring minimal downtime. I also track pending incidents, follow up with relevant teams, and make sure issues are closed properly.

### Maintenance & Security:
- I coordinate OS-level patching and other maintenance activities, scheduling downtime in line with client requirements. I also perform regular audits using AWS Security Hub to identify misconfigurations or vulnerabilitiesâ€”such as open security groups, missing MFA, or outdated packages. Once identified, I work with teams to remediate and ensure compliance.

### FinOps & Audit:
- I generate proactive reports on resource usage to optimize costs. For example, identifying unused EBS volumes, snapshots, and stopped EC2 instances, as well as underutilized compute resources. I then recommend rightsizing, downsizing, or setting up Auto Scaling Groups to handle traffic efficiently while keeping costs in check.

### Infrastructure Automation & Delivery:
- I have strong hands-on experience in implementing infrastructure on AWS using Terraform (IaC) for both EC2-based and ECS-based applications. I also integrate this into CI/CD workflows using Jenkins pipelines, ensuring automated provisioning, testing, and deployment of infrastructure and application code.

- Overall, my role balances operational stability, security, cost efficiency, and automation, making sure customer environments are both secure and optimized, while supporting smooth application delivery
