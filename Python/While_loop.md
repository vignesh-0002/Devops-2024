# The while Loop
- With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.
  ```python
  i = 1
  while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1
  ```
- `i += 1` is shorthand for saying `i = i + 1`
- It means, "Take the current value of `i` and add `1` to it, then store the result back into `i`.
- " Essentially, it's an increment operation that increases the value of `i` by `1` each time the loop runs.

## Hereâ€™s how your loop works:
- You start with `i = 1`.
- The condition `i < 6` is checked. If it's true `(which it is for i = 1)`, the loop runs.
- The `print(i)` line outputs the current value of `i`.
- Then, `i += 1` adds `1` to `i`. So, after the first run, `i` becomes `2`.
- The process repeats: the loop keeps running as long as `i < 6`. Once `i` reaches `6`, the condition `i < 6` becomes `false`, and the loop stops.
