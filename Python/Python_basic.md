# 1. What is **python**?
- Python is a coding language similar to C, C++, Java etc..
- Python is is a human readabla language, so it is called easy to learn language.
- And its widely used in many places like web development, data science, ML etc..
   
# 2. Why we need **python**?
- Well the answer is the same you should use python because of its versatile functionality.
- Because of its large libraries and eco system, making it ideal for various tasks like web development, data analytics, machine learning, automation, and scripting.

# 3. Python syntax:
- Python syntax can be executed by writing directly in the Command Line:
  ```
   print("Hello, World!")
  ```
- so you need to use `python` to run this syntax directly on terminal.
- Because when you type `python` or `python3` in the terminal and press `Enter`, the Python interpreter starts.
- It allows you to run Python Scripts.

# 4. Python Indentation:
- Python indendation reffers to the space in the begining of a line code.
- Unlike other programming language indentation is not only for readability, Python uses indentation to define blocks of code. 

   **Example:**
   ```
     if 5 > 2:
       print("Five is greater than two!") 
   ```

# 5. Python Variables:
- Variables are containers for storing data values.
- In Python, variables are created when you assign a value to it:

  **Example:**
    ```
    x = 5
    y = "Hello, World!"
    ```
- Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.

  **Example:**
    ```
    x = 4       # x is of type int
    x = "Sally" # x is now of type str
    print(x)
    ```

## Casting
- If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.

  **Example**
   ```
   x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
   y = int(3)    # y will be 3
   z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0   
   ```
## Get the Type
- You can get the data type of a variable with the type() function.
  **Example:**
  ```
  x = 5
  y = "John"
  print(type(x))
  print(type(y))
  ```
    
# 6. Python Comments:

- Comments starts with a #, and Python will ignore them:

  **Example:**
   ```
   #print("Hello, World!")

   ```
- Multiline Comments
  **Example:**
   ```
    """
     This is a comment
     written in
     more than just one line
    """
    print("Hello, World!")
   ```
