# List vs. Tuple in Python

Python provides two commonly used sequence types: **Lists** and **Tuples**.

| Feature      | List (`list`) | Tuple (`tuple`) |
|-------------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Mutable?** | ‚úÖ Yes (Can be changed) | ‚ùå No (Cannot be changed) |
| **Syntax**  | `[]` (Square brackets) | `()` (Parentheses) |
| **Performance** | Slower (because of mutability) | Faster (due to immutability) |
| **Use Case** | When data may change | When data should remain constant |

## Example Code

```python
# List Example (Mutable)
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
print("Original List:", my_list)

my_list.append(4)  # Adding an element
my_list[0] = 10    # Modifying an element
print("Modified List:", my_list)

# Tuple Example (Immutable)
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
print("\nOriginal Tuple:", my_tuple)

# This will cause an error because tuples are immutable
try:
    my_tuple[0] = 10  # Attempt to modify (not allowed)
except TypeError as e:
    print("Error:", e)
```

## Why is a List Mutable but a Tuple Immutable?
- **Lists store references to objects**, so elements inside a list can be changed.
- **Tuples store values directly**, making them **fixed** after creation, which improves performance and prevents accidental modifications.

Use **lists** when you need flexibility and **tuples** when you want to protect data from unintended changes! üöÄ
