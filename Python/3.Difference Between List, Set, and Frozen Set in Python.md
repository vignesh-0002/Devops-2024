# Difference Between List, Set, and Frozen Set in Python

Python provides **Lists (`list`)**, **Sets (`set`)**, and **Frozen Sets (`frozenset`)** to store collections of elements, but they have key differences.

| Feature      | **List (`list`)** | **Set (`set`)** | **Frozen Set (`frozenset`)** |
|-------------|------------------|----------------|---------------------------|
| **Ordering** | ✅ Ordered (Maintains insertion order) | ❌ Unordered (No specific order) | ❌ Unordered (No specific order) |
| **Duplicates** | ✅ Allows duplicates | ❌ Does not allow duplicates | ❌ Does not allow duplicates |
| **Mutability** | ✅ Mutable (Can modify elements) | ✅ Mutable (Can add/remove elements, but individual items are immutable) | ❌ Immutable (Cannot add/remove elements after creation) |
| **Indexing** | ✅ Supports indexing (e.g., `my_list[0]`) | ❌ No indexing (Elements cannot be accessed by position) | ❌ No indexing (Elements cannot be accessed by position) |
| **Performance** | ❌ Slower for searches (`O(n)`) | ✅ Faster for searches (`O(1)`) due to hash table implementation | ✅ Faster for searches (`O(1)`) due to hash table implementation |
| **Use Case** | When you need ordered, duplicate elements with indexing | When you need unique elements with fast lookups | When you need unique, unchangeable elements |

## Example Code

```python
# List Example
my_list = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4]
print("List:", my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4]

# Set Example
my_set = {1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4}
print("Set:", my_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4} (Duplicates removed)

# Frozen Set Example
my_frozenset = frozenset([1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4])
print("Frozen Set:", my_frozenset)  # Output: frozenset({1, 2, 3, 4})

# Indexing in List
print("First element in list:", my_list[0])  # Works

# Indexing in Set (Will cause an error)
try:
    print(my_set[0])  # Not allowed
except TypeError as e:
    print("Error:", e)

# Adding elements
my_list.append(5)  # Works
my_set.add(5)  # Works, but only if 5 is not already present

# Adding elements to Frozen Set (Will cause an error)
try:
    my_frozenset.add(5)  # Not allowed
except AttributeError as e:
    print("Error:", e)
```

## When to Use a List, Set, or Frozen Set?
- Use a **List** when **order matters**, duplicates are needed, or you need **index-based access**.
- Use a **Set** when **uniqueness is required**, and you want **fast lookups**.
- Use a **Frozen Set** when you need **unique elements that should not be modified after creation**.
