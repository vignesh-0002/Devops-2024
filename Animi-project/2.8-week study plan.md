# 🗓️ 8-Week Study Plan to Build Your Anime Image App (Beginner Friendly)

---

## 📌 Assumptions:
- You can commit **1–2 hours per day**, 5–6 days a week.
- Your goal: **Python + Image Processing + AnimeGANv2 + Streamlit app**

---

## 🧭 Week 1: Python Basics (Syntax + Logic)
✅ **Goal:** Get comfortable writing basic Python programs.

**Topics:**
- Variables, data types (`int`, `str`, `list`, `dict`)
- Conditions (`if`, `else`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- Functions
- Basic file I/O

**Resources:**
- [W3Schools Python](https://www.w3schools.com/python/)
- [Python Exercises – Practice](https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/)
  
**Mini Project:** Build a simple calculator or a to-do list in Python.

---

## 🧭 Week 2: Python with Images (OpenCV or Pillow)
✅ **Goal:** Learn how to load, display, and modify images.

**Topics:**
- Install OpenCV: `pip install opencv-python`
- Read/display images
- Resize, rotate, crop
- Apply filters (blur, edge detection, grayscale)

**Resources:**
- [OpenCV Python Tutorial](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d6/d00/tutorial_py_root.html)
- YouTube: *OpenCV Basics for Beginners*

**Mini Project:** Load an image and apply basic filters (e.g., cartoon effect using edge detection).

---

## 🧭 Week 3: Deeper Image Effects + Cartoon Filters
✅ **Goal:** Apply simple "cartoon" style manually to photos.

**Topics:**
- Convert image to sketch (grayscale + blur + edge mask)
- Combine sketch + color to create cartoonified image
- Save output image

**Resources:**
- [Cartoonify with OpenCV – Article](https://data-flair.training/blogs/cartooning-an-image-using-opencv-python/)
  
**Mini Project:** Build your own “Cartoonify Me” tool.

---

## 🧭 Week 4: Learn About AI Image Models (AnimeGANv2)
✅ **Goal:** Understand how AI models like AnimeGAN work and how to use pre-trained ones.

**Topics:**
- What is AnimeGAN / CartoonGAN?
- Using GitHub repo for AnimeGANv2
- Running pre-trained model in Colab or locally
- Try converting your own photo

**Resources:**
- [AnimeGANv2 GitHub](https://github.com/TachibanaYoshino/AnimeGANv2)
- [Google Colab Guide](https://colab.research.google.com/)

**Mini Project:** Run AnimeGANv2 in Colab and generate anime image from your photo.

---

## 🧭 Week 5: Build Simple Web App with Streamlit
✅ **Goal:** Create a basic image upload & display app.

**Topics:**
- Install Streamlit: `pip install streamlit`
- Upload image
- Display original + processed image
- Add buttons, titles, etc.

**Resources:**
- [Streamlit Docs](https://docs.streamlit.io/)
- YouTube: *Build Web Apps with Python & Streamlit*

**Mini Project:** Upload photo and apply cartoon filter using OpenCV + Streamlit.

---

## 🧭 Week 6: Integrate AnimeGAN Model with Streamlit
✅ **Goal:** Make a working anime generator web app.

**Topics:**
- Load the AnimeGAN model in backend
- Process user-uploaded image
- Show before-after preview

**Mini Project:** Final Anime Generator App (local version)

---

## 🧭 Week 7: Polish the UI and Add Features
✅ **Goal:** Make it smooth, fun, and user-friendly.

**Add-ons:**
- Loading spinner while processing
- Add multiple anime styles
- Option to download image

---

## 🧭 Week 8: Deploy and Share 🎉
✅ **Goal:** Make your app public!

**Options:**
- [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud) (Free Hosting)
- [Render](https://render.com/)
- [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces) (for ML apps)

---

## 💡 Bonus Tips:
- Use **Google Colab** for free GPU when testing AnimeGANv2.
- Create a **GitHub repo** to track your progress.
- Share on **Reddit** / **Instagram** when you’re done — this is viral stuff!
