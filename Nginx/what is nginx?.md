## **Key Features**

### 1. **High-Performance HTTP Server**
- Handles static and dynamic content efficiently.
- Optimized for serving a large number of simultaneous connections (asynchronous and event-driven).

### 2. **Reverse Proxy**
- Acts as an intermediary to forward client requests to backend servers.
- Improves performance with caching and request handling.

### 3. **Load Balancing**
- Distributes traffic across multiple backend servers.
- Supports algorithms such as Round Robin, Least Connections, and IP Hash.

### 4. **TLS/SSL Support**
- Secure communication using HTTPS.
- Supports modern security protocols and features like HTTP/2 and OCSP stapling.

### 5. **Content Caching**
- Efficiently caches static content for faster delivery.
- Reduces backend load by serving cached responses.

### 6. **URL Rewriting and Redirection**
- Flexible URL manipulation using rewrite rules.
- Redirects requests based on conditions or paths.

### 7. **Modular Architecture**
- Lightweight and modular with the ability to enable or disable modules.
- Includes built-in modules for logging, compression, and performance tuning.

### 8. **Compression**
- Reduces bandwidth usage with Gzip and Brotli compression.
- Optimizes content delivery for users.

### 9. **Integration with FastCGI, WSGI, and SCGI**
- Provides support for running applications written in languages like PHP, Python, and Ruby.

### 10. **Monitoring and Logging**
- Customizable logging for access and errors.
- Integration with monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana.
