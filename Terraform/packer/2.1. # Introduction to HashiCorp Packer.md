# Introduction to HashiCorp Packer

All right, folks, welcome to the first section of this course.

This section is called **Introduction to HashiCorp Packer**.

## Section Overview

- We'll talk about **what Packer is** and some of the things that organizations are using **Packer** to accomplish in their day-to-day activities.
- We'll cover the **primary use cases** that **Packer** aims to solve.
- Then, we'll jump into learning more about the **core components** of a **Packer template**.
- We'll move over to a more technical discussion, and start talking about **how to install Packer** on your local machine or another machine that's going to be running **Packer builds** for you.
- We'll discuss how to interact with **Packer** on a day-to-day basis when you're starting to learn to configure **Packer** and actually implement it in your organization using the **CLI**.
- Finally, in the section, we'll talk about the **Packer workflow**. 

So, it's one thing to just learn how to do a `packer build` command, but really understanding what's happening in the background when you execute a `packer build` is going to be fundamental for you to learn in order to really understand how **Packer** works.
