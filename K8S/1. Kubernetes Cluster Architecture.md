# Kubernetes Cluster Architecture: Key Concepts

## Overview

This document provides a high-level summary of Kubernetes cluster architecture based on an introductory lecture. The architecture is explained using a ship analogy to illustrate how Kubernetes components interact.

## 1. Core Components of Kubernetes Architecture

| Component            | Role/Function                                           | Analogy (Ship)          |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Master Node         | Manages the cluster                                     | Control Ship           |
| Worker Node         | Hosts application containers                            | Cargo Ship             |
| etcd                | Key-value store for cluster state                       | Information Log        |
| Kube API Server     | Central management and orchestration API                | Communication Office   |
| Kube Scheduler      | Assigns containers (pods) to nodes                      | Crane & Planning Dept. |
| Controllers         | Manage specific cluster aspects (nodes, replication)    | Various Departments    |
| Kubelet             | Agent on each node to manage containers                 | Ship Captain           |
| Kube Proxy          | Enables network communication between services/nodes    | Communication Lines    |
| Container Runtime   | Runs containers (e.g., Docker, ContainerD)              | Engine Room            |

## 2. Master Node Components

- **etcd**
  - Distributed key-value store.
  - Stores cluster configuration and state data.

- **Kube API Server**
  - Exposes the Kubernetes API.
  - Facilitates communication between components and external clients.

- **Kube Scheduler**
  - Assigns pods to nodes based on resource availability and policies.
  - Considers:
    - Resource requirements.
    - Node capacity.
    - Affinity/anti-affinity rules.
    - Taints and tolerations.

- **Controllers**
  - **Node Controller**: Manages node lifecycle (join, leave, fail).
  - **Replication Controller**: Ensures desired number of pod replicas.
  - Other controllers handle specialized tasks.

---

## 3. Worker Node Components

- **Kubelet**
  - Agent running on each worker node.
  - Registers node with master.
  - Deploys and monitors containers based on instructions from the API server.

- **Kube Proxy**
  - Manages network rules to enable service discovery and communication.
  - Ensures containers on different nodes can reach each other.

- **Container Runtime**
  - Executes containers (e.g., Docker, ContainerD).
  - Must be installed on all nodes, including master nodes if control components are containerized.

## 4. Analogy Recap

| Ship Analogy      | Kubernetes Component                |
|-------------------|------------------------------------|
| Control Ship      | Master Node                        |
| Cargo Ship        | Worker Node                        |
| Captain           | Kubelet                            |
| Crane             | Kube Scheduler                     |
| Information Log   | etcd                               |
| Departments       | Controllers                        |
| Communication Line| Kube Proxy                         |

## 5. Summary

- Kubernetes architecture involves:
  - **Master Node(s)** managing the cluster.
  - **Worker Node(s)** running application containers.
- Communication is orchestrated through the **Kube API Server**.
- State management is handled via **etcd**.
- Scheduling and replication ensure workload distribution and high availability.
- Networking is managed by **Kube Proxy** and container runtimes.

## Next Steps

- Deep dive into each component with detailed configurations.
- Hands-on practice identifying cluster components using practice tests.
