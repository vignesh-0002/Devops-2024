# Common Networking Questions in DevOps

## 1. Networking Basics
- **What is a Network?**
  - A system of interconnected devices sharing resources.
- **What is an IP Address?**
  - A unique identifier for devices in a network.
- **What is DNS?**
  - Domain Name System, resolves domain names to IP addresses.

## 2. Protocols and Standards
- **What is HTTP/HTTPS?**
  - Protocols for web communication; HTTPS is secure.
- **What is TCP/UDP?**
  - TCP ensures reliable data transmission; UDP is faster but less reliable.
- **What is SSH?**
  - Secure Shell, used for remote login and command execution.

## 3. Load Balancing and High Availability
- **What is a Load Balancer?**
  - Distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers.
- **Explain Horizontal vs. Vertical Scaling.**
  - Horizontal: Adding more servers; Vertical: Upgrading a single server.

## 4. Networking in Cloud
- **What is a VPC?**
  - Virtual Private Cloud, isolated network within a public cloud.
- **What are Security Groups?**
  - Rules to control inbound and outbound traffic for cloud instances.

## 5. Network Troubleshooting
- **How to troubleshoot network issues?**
  - Use tools like `ping`, `traceroute`, `netstat`, `tcpdump`, and `telnet`.
- **What is NAT?**
  - Network Address Translation, maps private IPs to public IPs.

## 6. DevOps-Specific Networking
- **Explain CI/CD Networking Challenges.**
  - Firewall rules, load balancing, and DNS propagation.
- **What is Service Discovery?**
  - Identifying services in dynamic environments, often using tools like Consul or Kubernetes DNS.

## 7. Security in Networking
- **What is a VPN?**
  - Virtual Private Network, secures communication over public networks.
- **Explain Firewall and its Types.**
  - Filters traffic; types include packet filtering, stateful, and application-layer firewalls.

## 8. Tools and Automation
- **Which tools are used for network monitoring?**
  - Tools like Nagios, Zabbix, Prometheus, and Wireshark.
- **How is networking automated in DevOps?**
  - Using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform, Ansible, or CloudFormation.
