                B --> C[Wait to be selected]
```               

```mermaid      
            graph TD
                A[Appear in the Mock Interviews organized by the campus] --> B[Get some feedback on what to improve]
                B --> C[Find your own ways to make the improvements]
                C --> D[Appear in another mock interview and still get the same feedback or totally opposite]
                D --> E[Appear in real interview and try your best but miss being selected]

## Introduction & Overview Summary

Most of us either
- ➢ start revising all the stuff we have learnt, or
- ➢ if lucky, get opportunities to go through mock interviews.

This process is not very effective for most of us because
- ➢ we don’t get enough time to prepare, and
- ➢ we don’t prepare the right things.

We need to consider adopting a process that can help you
- ➢ prepare the right things, and
- ➢ be ready in time to do well in your interviews.

We have a process that can help you succeed in your interviews by
- ➢ planning the preparation,
- ➢ preparing the right things, and
- ➢ then performing with confidence.
