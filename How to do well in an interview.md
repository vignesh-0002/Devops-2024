## Introduction and Overview Summary

Most of us either
- ➢ start revising all the stuff we have learnt, or
- ➢ if lucky, get opportunities to go through mock interviews.

This process is not very effective for most of us because
- ➢ we don’t get enough time to prepare, and
- ➢ we don’t prepare the right things.

We need to consider adopting a process that can help you
- ➢ prepare the right things, and
- ➢ be ready in time to do well in your interviews.

We have a process that can help you succeed in your interviews by
- ➢ planning the preparation,
- ➢ preparing the right things, and
- ➢ then performing with confidence.

# 2_How to do well in an interview? What to plan and how?

## Current Process Review

What do you do now to plan to do well in your interviews and how effective is it?

| Current Process       | Process Effectiveness     |
|-----------------------|---------------------------|
|                       |                           |
|                       |                           |
|                       |                           |

## Current Process and its effectiveness

Most of us don’t plan properly for doing well in
our interview
+ We start our preparation for the interview as and
when we find time, sometimes just a day or right
ahead of the interview
+ This process in not very effective for most of us
as we don’t get enough time to prepare and
don’t prepare the right things
+ And this lack of planning leads to us being
unprepared and not confident in the interview
+ Leading to us not doing well in the interview

## Why not consider a process that:
+ CAN PROVIDE ENOUGH TIME to prepare well
+ Helps you PREAPRE WHAT WILL BE ASKED
+ Helps you PERFORM CONFIDENTLY in the interview

## What did we learn in this module
 **Most of us don’t properly plan for an interview;** we may just start preparing a day or night ahead!

 **This process is not very effective** for most of us, as we don’t get enough time to prepare and don’t focus on the right things.

 **We need to consider adopting a process** that helps us prepare the right things in time and approach interviews confidently.

 **We now know the key aspects to plan for,** such as:  
  - How to connect or reach the interview location.  
  - What to wear and carry.  
  - What to prepare and practice.

We also understand how to plan these steps** by creating an **Activity Schedule** to ensure timely and effective preparation, enabling us to feel well-prepared and confident during the interview.

# Key Points: Managing Job Interview Anxiety

## Understanding Anxiety
- Anxiety is common during interviews and can vary in levels for different individuals.
- A certain minimum level of anxiety is beneficial as it provides energy to perform.
- Anxiety stems from **expectations about the future** and uncertainty regarding outcomes.

## Pre-Interview Anxiety Management
1. **Understand the Source**:  
   Anxiety arises from high expectations about future events.  
   - Balance expectations: Focus on performing your best, not the outcome.
   - Follow the principle: *Do your duty and let go of the results*.

2. **Preparation is Key**:  
   - Plan thoroughly: Research the job, review the job description, and anticipate questions.  
   - Practice:  
     - Conduct mock interviews.  
     - Prepare answers to common questions.  
   - Aim for readiness to perform anytime.  

3. **Channel Energy**:  
   - Focus your energy on preparation rather than worrying about results.  
   - Avoid overthinking by staying occupied with actionable steps.

## Managing Anxiety During the Interview
1. **Self-Talk for Confidence**:  
   - Remind yourself:  
     - "I have done my best in preparation."  
     - "The outcome is not under my control."  
   - Focus on performing in the moment.

2. **Physical and Mental Alignment**:  
   - Physical activity:  
     - Pace the room to balance mental and physical energy.  
   - Relaxation techniques:  
     - Practice meditation to calm the mind.  
     - Use controlled, deep breathing to slow down and stabilize.

## Long-Term Practices
- **Meditation & Yoga**:  
  - Regular practice helps in controlling thoughts and reducing anxiety.  
- **Mindfulness**:  
  - Develop habits to stay present and reduce overthinking about the future.  

## Additional Resources
- Explore courses on time management and stress management to build long-term resilience.
- Look into tools for meditation and mental focus to maintain calmness in stressful situations.

## Key Takeaway
- Focus on what you can control—preparation and performance.  
- Let go of the results and trust the process.
- Embrace the philosophy: *Do your best and leave the rest to the universe.*

## How to Prepare for an Interview

### 1. **Prepare for Your Entry**
- If face-to-face:  
  - Plan your greeting, handshake, and opening remarks.  
  - Decide on how to address the interviewer (e.g., Mr./Ms. [Last Name]).  
- If online:  
  - Test audio and video.  
  - Acknowledge confirmations with gratitude.  
  - Prepare for small talk to establish rapport.  

---

### 2. **Introductory Questions**
Key questions to prepare for:
- Tell me about yourself.  
- Why should we hire you?  
- What are your strengths and weaknesses?  

#### Approach:
- Study the **Job Description (JD)** and identify required **Knowledge, Attitude, and Skills (KAS).**  
- Match these to your qualifications and experiences.  
- Highlight 5-6 strong points and structure your answers around them.  
- Practice responses and refine based on feedback.

---

### 3. **Role-Specific and CV-Based Questions**
- Review the JD carefully.  
- Prepare for potential questions about your skills, experiences, and job-relevant scenarios.  
- Anticipate “Tell me more about...” and “What’s not in your CV?” questions.  
- Write concise, bullet-point responses and practice them.

---

### 4. **Closing Questions**
- Examples include:  
  - “Do you have any questions for us?”  
  - “What is your current CTC, and what are your expectations?”  
  - “When can you join us?”  

#### Tips:
- Ask thoughtful, company-focused questions (e.g., “What does it take to be successful here?”).  
- Provide genuine and honest responses to salary and joining date queries.  

---

### 5. **Key Practices**
- **Build Trust:** Be genuine in your answers and acknowledge questions thoughtfully.  
- **Accept Nervousness:** Stay relaxed and confident despite natural nerves.  
- **Feedback Loop:** Regularly practice and improve with feedback from mock interviews.

---

## Recap of Learnings
