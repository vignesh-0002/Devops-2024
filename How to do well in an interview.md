## Introduction and Overview Summary

Most of us either
- ➢ start revising all the stuff we have learnt, or
- ➢ if lucky, get opportunities to go through mock interviews.

This process is not very effective for most of us because
- ➢ we don’t get enough time to prepare, and
- ➢ we don’t prepare the right things.

We need to consider adopting a process that can help you
- ➢ prepare the right things, and
- ➢ be ready in time to do well in your interviews.

We have a process that can help you succeed in your interviews by
- ➢ planning the preparation,
- ➢ preparing the right things, and
- ➢ then performing with confidence.

## Current Process Review

What do you do now to plan to do well in your interviews and how effective is it?

| Current Process       | Process Effectiveness     |

|                       |                           |
|                       |                           |

## Current Process and its effectiveness

Most of us don’t plan properly for doing well in
our interview
+ We start our preparation for the interview as and
when we find time, sometimes just a day or right
ahead of the interview
+ This process in not very effective for most of us
as we don’t get enough time to prepare and
don’t prepare the right things
+ And this lack of planning leads to us being
unprepared and not confident in the interview
+ Leading to us not doing well in the interview

## Why not consider a process that.
+ CAN PROVIDE ENOUGH TIME to prepare well
+ Helps you PREAPRE WHAT WILL BE ASKED
+ Helps you PERFORM CONFIDENTLY in the interview
