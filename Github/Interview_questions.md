## 5. Define the basic components of Linux.
The five basic components of Linux are:
1. **Kernel:** The core of the OS, acting as a bridge between hardware and software.
2. **Shell:** Interface between the user and kernel.
3. **GUI:** Graphical interface for user interaction.
4. **Application Programs:** Software designed to perform specific tasks.
5. **System Utilities:** Tools for managing the system.

## 6. Elaborate all the file permissions in Linux.
Linux has three types of file permissions:
- **Read:** Allows opening and reading files.
- **Write:** Allows modifying files.
- **Execute:** Allows running files.

## 8. Explain LILO.
LILO (Linux Loader) is a bootloader for Linux that loads the operating system into memory and starts execution.

---

## 9. What is Shell in Linux?
Linux uses five types of shells:
1. **csh (C Shell):** Provides job control and spell checking.
2. **ksh (Korn Shell):** High-level shell for programming.
3. **ssh (Z Shell):** Features like file name generation and comment closing.
4. **bash (Bourne Again Shell):** Default shell in Linux.
5. **Fish (Friendly Interactive Shell):** Offers auto-suggestions and web-based configuration.

## 15. How do users create a symbolic link in Linux?
Symbolic links (symlinks) are shortcuts to files and directories. Use the `ln` command:
    ```bash
                         
                         ln -s <existing_source_file> <optional_symbolic_link>
## 16.  What do you understand about the standard streams?
Linux uses three standard streams for communication:

- **stdin:** Standard input.
- **stdout:** Standard output.
- **stderr:** Standard error.

## 17. How do you mount and unmount filesystems in Linux?

You can use the `mount` and `umount` commands to handle filesystems.

**For Mounting:**
1. Identify the partition using the `fdisk -l` or `lsblk` command.
2. Create a directory to serve as the mount point:
   ```bash
   mkdir /mnt/mountpnt

3. Mount the partition:
```
sudo mount <partition> <mount_point_directory>
```
4. For Unmounting:

- Check if the specific filesystem is in use.
- Unmount using the following command:
```
sudo umount <mount_point_directory>
```
